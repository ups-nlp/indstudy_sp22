classroom one of his students meghan mascaras the rock star of the seventh grade is reading aloud from a biology textbook a common enough activity though somehow it looks oddly constrained at the moment still meghan does the best she can under the circumstances the giant squid is a shy and solisolitary animal seldom if ever seen by humans she reads nevertheless giant squid carcacarcacarcasses that have washed up on beaches in many parts of the world have given rise to legends of sea monsters like the kkkraken since the squid has eight long legs and two more members that are even longer

aronstein to whom you are supposed to deliver a candy gram mr mcdell winks at you and continues to tell his class about the crusades the crusades were a violent and awful mess he says but sometimes

elevenyearold sixth graders you would guess bounce out of a rest room to the south chatting fervently ones moving a little faster than the others and gets ahead of her friends and so she spins around to face them as she continues to walk along the hall backwards since she cant see where shes going the backwards walker veers across the hall unpredictably bumping into all three of you judy and queenie take the little collision as a matter of course but the sixth graders react with silent terror two scramble away to the north but one the girl who bumped into you freezes well stephanie it looks like youre in big trouble now says judy with an inflection that you but not the sixth grader recognize as jocose you flash back for a moment to your own sixth grade experience when you and your friends would discuss quite seriously whether it was possible for a big kid to literally stuff a little kid into a locker you can see a basket which is empty judy queenie and stephanie here talk to stephanie what would you like to say why dont you watch where youre going oh dont worry its ok select an option or to say nothin  umi wasor i thought i was stephanie looks as though shes about to start crying g what would you like to say why dont you watch where youre going oh dont worry its ok select an option or to say nothin  thanks ah good look at stephanie stephanie is a fairly typical sixthgrade girl eleven or so years old four feet or so in height weighing no more than seventyfive pounds recovering some of her composure stephanie escapes quietly to the north you imagine that youre feeling almost as relieved as she is at her exit you check your supply of candy grams noting that all the pops have survived put gram in basket you purchase a candy gram for mr pisces and put it into the basket putting a coin into the envelope in payment judy dutifully fills out the proper paperwork pretty nice says queenie you seem to be into some good things what else interests you what would you like to say you have an unusual nickname queenie how did you get it you said you used to like fantasy but not any more why is that ask queenie about herself i notice that you have a little scar if you dont mind my asking how did you come by that select an option or to say nothin  theres not much to say really my family just moved here from the next town over ive been out of school since last summer because of a pretty bad car crash somebody ran a stop sign at least nobody got killed or cripplednot too badly crippled anyway as for the weird nickname i took it from a story i read once on the computer it was about a middle school girl who was killed in a crash before she died she had dreams about being the queen of the dead your score has just gone up by one point open door you open the door to room west room this is the wellstocked math classroom of ms garrulous it has lots of colorful posters a small refrigerator and pictures of family membersall the comforts of home the exit

the room has been set up as a onechair hair salon a girl whom you recognize as alexis a seventh grader is sitting in a chair at the back of the room while the teacher trims some of her green spiked hair leaving her with a much more conservative look danielle dejonses is offering generous helpings of coaching to both barber and barbee and as usual people are listening now you see ms g what youre really doing here is not just cutting hair no youre not youre taking alex back to alex youre making the girl what she is and thats a good thing now we all know that what alex is an individual shes her own girl and some day soon shell be her own woman and thats why she got her green spiky hair to show shes not just like everybody else but her mistake was that the girlthis girl right hereshe is isnt a punk just like shes not a skinhead or a greaser maybe she doesnt even know exactly what she is well put danielle says ms g but why would a finelooking young lady like alexis get green hair in the first place alexis starts to answer but seeing that danielle is still on a roll she decides to defer to her im glad you asked me that says danielle of course i dont exactly know but probably alexis was hurting a little and figured shed be somebody else for a while and see if the somebody else wasnt hurting so much shes back on the right track now though nobody knows where shell end up but shes on the right track you marvel at danielles effect on her listeners she really sounds like she means what she says as ms garrulous finishes her hair cutting she suggests that you make your candy gram delivery you can see judy queenie alexis danielle dejonses ms garrulous and a cake here give gram to danielle first taking the candygram danielle thanks you and passes the candy pop along to alexis sweet reward for a sweet decision she explains well ms g danielle continues this minicourse is pretty good today lots more memorable than anything we learn in math classthats for sure oh i dont know about that says ms garrulous rising to the challenge i think that some of us may remember a math lesson or two take doug here for example ill bet that with his work in the enterprise business he can use some math that hes not studying at the moment after glancing around the classroom for a half minute ms garrulous finds a suitable challenge please take a look at the cake that we have here doug as you can see theres a piece missing what number appeared on that piece to answer type say numerical answer to garrulous in other words if your answer is type say to garrulous your score has just gone

permission she chides get out of here at once and dont come back until youre ready to be more polite she closes the door rather firmly in your face knock on door ms empirious meets you just outside the door and closes it behind her blocking your path into the room at least you knocked this time she says thats an improvement but its not good enough do you have anything to say to me talk to empirious ms empirious what would you like to say apologize to ms empirious you have to love danielle dejonses though dont you select an option or to say nothin  ms empirious accepts your apology and invites you into room please wait until my demonstration is concluded before you make your deliveries she says ms empirious returns to room leaving the door open for you west room this is the science classroom usually occupied by ms empirious a young science teacher whose strictness and inflexibility are the stuff of middle school legend a note scrawled lightly in pencil beside the door reads abandon hope all you who enter here actually the note has been written so lightly that you probably wouldnt notice it if you hadnt put it there the exit is to the east as you pass through the room doorway judy flashes a shy wave toward weird little ed dibbles a student in ms empirious class hi biff she whispers toward ed adoringly your heart sinks a bitbut your disappointment is exceeded by your incredulity ms empirious is presenting a chemistry demonstration near the front of the classroom not far from the door youve just entered shes standing behind a rather elaborate table with a twentygallon aquarium on top and a set of shelves that she can see and use though the front of the desk hides them from the class now class she says in her formal slightly singsongish voice please remember that like all of our demonstrations this look at the volatile properties of the element sodium is perfectly perfectly safe she removes a large jar with a viscous green substance in it from one of the shelves and places it on the desk for all to see in this jar she announces dramatically we have a few ounces of the very active metal called sodium to keep it from reacting with the surrounding atmosphere we keep it in the jar surrounded by an oily gel using a large pair of tweezers manipulated carefully in her left hand ms empirious lifts a greencoated cube about an inch on each side to the top of the jar next with a small sharplooking scissorlike device held in her right hand she snips off a tiny piece of the cube then she carefully lowers the cube back into the jar and moves the jar back to the shelf in front of her now class when i drop this tiny piece of sodium into the aquarium youll observe a rather violent reaction ms e drops the tiny piece of green covered stuff into the aquarium and sure enough it starts smoking and zooming around the surface of the water finally disappearing with a dramatically loud pop the class apparently loves the show and bursts into restrained but nearly unanimous applause reacting to this rare adulation from students ms empirious picks up a jar containing a greenish cube once again to show it off to the class but most atypically she moves too quickly and rather clumsily she juggles the jar momentarily and then drops it right into the aquarium ms e blesses herself rapidly and looks toward the sky as the class goes silent with terror you can see judy queenie ms empirious ed dibbles and an aquarium in which is a jar here your score has just gone up by one point take jar after pausing for a second or two to evaluate the situation noting that youre not dead yet you reach into the aquarium with your free hand and pluck out the jar which you notice does not actually seem to be smoking or sputtering at all ms e then bursts into laughter as the class becomes ready to kill her well done doug she chuckles you wouldnt have saved us if that had been a real jar of sodium but it was a brave thing to do anyway now class says the teacher i told you this was perfectly safe didnt i now that you look closely as i always urge you to do you can see that the jar doug pulled from the water is similar to but certainly not the same as the one i used earlier and alls well that ends well now enterprisers you may endeavor to deliver a candy gram or two you hand the ersatz sodium jar to ms empirious give gram to ed first taking the candygram ed thanks you and winks at judy as you finish making your delivery you notice that ms empirious is moving the original sodium jar from its shelf under the demonstration table presumably to a more permanent storage area you look twice to see whether this is the actual sodium jar but it certainly appears to be the real thing this time incredibly though as she lifts the jar ms e seems to experience a brief fainting spell and drops the jar squarely into the aquarium she blesses herself three times very rapidly and stares wideeyed into the tank the class gasps loudly hoping the end will be quick you decide you might as well repeat your previous heroics but youre half way across the room from the aquarium after your visit with ed nowhere near as close to the demonstration as you were before it takes you a full second or more to get to the front of the room and by that time youve noticed that once again theres absolutely no sign of any smoking or bubbling in the water this time queenie starts chuckling first followed closely by judy and ms e yes class once again you can see that our demonstration was perfectly safe the teacher coos the material you saw buzzing around and popping in the water at the start of the class was not pure sodium which would be too risky for us to keep around here it was actually a mechanical device designed to simulate sodium for chemistry demonstrations like this one so now youve learned and will never forget the highly reactive qualities of sodium and youve also learned to look twice mrs empirious now

inform v library nearly nearly the animal stink is rank and close you raise your crossbow try to peer beyond dark wet stone cock crossbow you pull down the lever winching the string back until it locks something shifts in the darkness ahead a great silent bulk your prey shoot prey tunk and you flinch at the hissing shriek that echoes down the cave walls the dark shape retreats scrambling away as your thudding pulse slows moments later barely sensed the scent of blood you have wounded the wumpus left you advance into the chamber a bat flutters in your face you swipe it away and three more bats replace it you duck swearing swearing again at a sharp nip on your arm drew blood it did there is a rustling all around you you try to remember what you know about the habits of cave bats oh you scramble back covering your eyes too late the swarm is on you harrying you small teeth and shrieks like shards of glass you cannot see you are running stumbling ahead of the storm the wumpus screams too close you thrash flinging something blindly at the new threat and as you recall what else you know of the hunting of bats the floor drops away to nothing beneath you pain x shape bottom of pit you roll painfully to hands and knees ah your arm nearly gives way you realize you somehow tore hell out of it on the way down or landing its bleeding freely this is the bottom of a wide pit the walls are entirely unclimbable of course the floor is rippled and uneven rising to sharp blades of stone near the edge mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere but theres no standing water so yes a narrow crawl leads down in the far corner a twisted shape lies nearby take rags the old fiber tears without too much strain you manage to rip loose some strips from the loose hems lying clear of the corpse what remains behind stained with old decay youd just as soon not touch a bat flutters down from overhead and another you wave your arms but theyre keeping their distance bandage arm with rags the cloth strips you quickly bind up your arm with the cloth it stanches the bleeding at least you only hope that you can get to better care before infection sets in more bats gather down you kneel stiffly and poke your head into the opening its tight and it looks like it gets tighter ahead no help for it you crawl inside tight crawl youre on your hands and knees in a throat of stone the roof dips even lower ahead if you advance itll be squirming forwards on your belly and squirming backwards will be impossible you think grimly ahead you hunch your elbows beneath your chest and wiggle forward on them into the gullet tight crawl you stop after a long silent time to rest crawling is hard work you know well and your aching shoulders and scraped knees attest to it but the crawl is no different here than anywhere you have just enough room to raise your head and theres nothing to see ahead but more stone to crawl through ahead you begin determinedly working yourself forward again tight crawl the rock is lower above you and narrower youre lying full length now your arms stretched out ahead but still rough stone scrapes your shoulders and you seem to be angling a bit downwards icy water is trickling past you your lamp flickers erratically the moisture must be getting to its workings ahead you continue scrabble with fingers brace arms push with toes youre definitely tilted headdown now is the stone pressing more tightly to either side of you tight crawl you lie on your side gasping trying to recover some strength your back is sore your neck is worse your head aches from cracking into unexpected stone a cold stony knot presses into your left side your right knee you stretch forward once more feeling for a few more inches before you continue splash your fingers are submerged in water ahead you stretch your hands forward submerging them hunch stretch inchworm inchworm your arms are submerged and water ripples at your chin no room to lift your head you turn your face to the side cheek scraping against the damn everpresent stone and stretch again your lamp flickers once and goes out tight crawl you are lying in cold still water it licks at your cheek and arms and across the backs of your thighs the chill makes your bruised knees and chest hurt all the more your neck screams from craning high enough to breathe but there is no room to sit up no room to turn no room ahead you struggle on you hope the water grows no deeper that thought occupies you for a few more hunches a few more stretches grow no deeper if the water grows deeper grow no deeper you shake that away and nothing comes to replace it you crawl on in the dark the water grows no deeper maybe its not as deep now tight crawl water trickles over your hands but the floor must have risen there is less of it a note of hope but you cannot see ahead you thrust your shoulders forward they stick ahead you push again its just this spot your hands are free in a wider area ahead but immovable stone grates against your chest and shoulders ahead youve got one shoulder past the edge the other is behind a corner of stone and you cant imagine how its going to get through ahead you brace your legs as best you can and shove futilely against the trap ahead you brace your legs as best you can and shove futilely against the trap you are never going to leave this place ahead you brace your legs as best you can and shove it feels like scraping flesh from bone but your shoulder tears past the edge you lie and gasp for a moment and then work your torso painfully through the gap the passage slants sharply down now but its widening its widening you halfcrawl halfslide downward dragging your legs out of the gap and come to rest in what seems like blinding light exhaustion ahead smallish cave eventually you manage to sit up and look around you are in a smallish roundish cave gravel and small rock chips cover the ground water trickles audibly somewhere nearby a path runs right a steep crack heads left and a pit climbs up wait time passes wait time passes a scrap of shadow flickers across a wall wait time passes wait time passes again shadowflutter more bats they dont seem to have noticed you yet

the bats cluster on the ground near the path to the right they seem to be licking at the stone right cramped room this is a cramped roundish room which is mazed with deep cracks the uncertain light seems a bit brighter a passage heads up a wide tunnel leads forward and a passage leads left bats flutter wildly about disturbed by your arrival wait time passes one bat then another settles to the ground near the passage leading up you shift back uneasily but they are staying well away wait time passes x bats the bats cluster on the ground near the passage leading up they seem to be licking at the stone up the passage opens abruptly into vast space base of canyon you are in an alcove a side chamber at the base of a vaulting canyon the walls spread upward around you and the distant roof is hung with glimmering stars droplettipped stalactites in some hidden suffusion of light you think against your will that it was worth it a crevice runs along the canyon at your feet you can cross it and continue on ahead or reenter the crawl behind you the wumpus certainly fled this way a pool of thick dark reeking blood is spilled across the ground bats crawl all around it rustling fluttering feasting x pool the pool is clotted and dark nearly black in this dim light it is bitter and foul it already smells of decay and bats squat all around it remove bandage you carefully unwrap the cloth from your arm the worst of the bleeding has stopped although there is still a fierce ache and a slow trickle of blood wait time passes a bat suddenly pokes its stained nose up above the pool casting about wait time passes another bats flutters down from above and pushes into the mass wait time passes two of the bats rattle up and begin circling above you wait time passes wait time passes several of the bats are fluttering in the air around you ignoring the drying pool of blood nearby ahead a cluster of bats flickers after you chittering you hunch your shoulders and try to ignore them you heave yourself wearily over the crevice and approach the twisted formations that make up the far canyon wall and you round a pillar and stop there here now canyon wall massive buttresses of stone rise all around you climbing the canyon wall flowing down again in cascades of pale fluorite a path seems to climb up among them but you dont think you can get to it right now the wumpus is crouched before you blood trickles from the wound your bolt tore down its hide puddling on the floor it holds your crossbow in its claws gently cradled loaded and cocked steady on your throat the bats dive forward then rise emitting glassshrill cries wait time passes more bats are arriving streaming across the canyon wait time passes the swarm grows thicker swirling above the wumpus which tosses its head around angrily before returning its gaze to you wait time passes the wumpus grunts and swats at an overbold bat the tiny shape shrieks and falls broken to the ground but the wumpus hisses as well and shakes blood from its forelimb and the swarm descends ahead you take a hesitant step sideways and another sliding past the beast trying to be a thin part of the canyon wall the wumpus lashing out at bats doesnt seem to notice rising path you are partway up the canyon wall on a narrow path that climbs from ledge to ledge the cavern is vast around you waterhewn strata stretching upward to the stone forest of the roof and somewhere above you a crack of daylight sets it all glimmering down on the canyon floor the wumpus thrashes within a rustling black cloud dark growls rise to you up you awaken in your tent lying on the floor with a hangover like you wouldnt believe as you lever yourself up you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and roboffs usual shouting this can only mean one thing roboff must have finally run off on you panicked you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor at least roboff had the sense to not trigger

passes the ground here seems slightly unstable it trembles and you lose your balance z time passes you can tell the geyser is trying to erupt but cant because of the air bladder the pressure builds and builds until finally large cracks appear in the floor with a huge bang the floor breaks open the west wall topples over under the pressure and gallons of sulfurous water shoot into the air moments

like the ice has been here for quite some time chop ice with axe you heave your axe into the ice to your surprise you actually chip off a few pieces itll take a bit more work to make any real progress

read book you flip through the book and come to the section on the fabled dragons of the sixth layer it states that there are three fearsome dragons in this part of the underworld that must be challenged before the jewel can be obtained the first is the white dragon which lives in a cold and icy lair his deadliest weapon is a cone of frost that can freeze an entire army dead in their tracks he is the oldest and wisest of the dragons the black dragon is another fearsome opponent his breath weapon is a stream of acid that can corrode the toughest of metals not to mention bone and skin the oracles have sensed that he is a rather lazy dragon and is content to count his baubles rather than concern himself with otherworldly affairs the final dragon and fabled keeper of the jewel is the fearsome red dragon she is the strongest of the dragons and breathes an indefensible blast of fire which will incinerate anything it touches the red dragon is merciless she will always prefer to attack first and ask questions later if theres anyone left to answer although these dragons have never been viewed the oracles are reasonably sure of these facts because of years of meditation and mystical incantations they also seem certain that reaching the red dragons lair by conventional methods if this is in fact possible will require overcoming three separate hurdles ask allarah about white timbork the white dragon has been a bit of a mystery to us of late recently our druids have had trouble sensing his life forces and pinpointing his exact whereabouts quite peculiar indeed ask allarah about black rasha the black dragon lies warily playing with his many baubles and trinkets he prefers to keep to himself and as far as we can tell lies barricaded behind a strong locked door we are not certain but we believe that this door can only be unlocked with an ebony key which is possessed by rasha himself through extensive praying and meditation we have envisioned the keys shape and appearance based on our druids visions our blacksmiths have made a copy and we would like you to have it allarah hands you a heavy ebony key furthermore we feel that once rasha is finally confronted he can be brought into conversation out of sheer boredom like all dragons rasha is quite powerful however dont let his bravado fool you rasha is a coward at heart and will do just about anything to save himself your score has just gone up by three points ask allarah about red helspeth the red dragon will present you with many problems we have sensed through prayer that approaching her lair by any straightforward method is impossible as a result youll have to find some other approach being the guardian of the fabled jewel she will kill without any pretenses as another security measure the jewel is not located directly in her chamber but rather in an antechamber that is only accessible by water ask allarah about jewel ah yes the jewel of knowledge you will find it in helspeth the red dragons lair if you succeed in your mission you will have the powers of the strongest mage and the omniscience of a god hearing it put that way you feel a sudden sense of hubris working its way out of your bowels omniscience and unlimited power are better suited to those celestial beings that have had eternities to master their abilities is it right for a mortal to wield such power is it safe was

east you bravely push on through the obsidian door black dragons lair youre in a huge black cavern high atop the walls torches keep the room well lit the floor here is made of polished stone which is quite uncommon in the underground the room is quite tidy and you marvel at the fact that there isnt any dust a passage leads off to the east and a rocky ramp leads up to the southeast a black dragon the size of a small temple is playing with a little trinket in the corner of this room he notices your entry and a slow grin spreads across his face well hello there i havent had company for over a century let me guess youre a freelance scribe and youre looking to write my autobiography no youre not wearing spectacles and youre too muscular could you be a new servant sent here to do my bidding probably not that fire in your eyes is unbecoming of paid help ive got it youre here in search of treasure and adventure maybe a tussle with the great black dragon or a scavenger hunt through his treasure room he says with a quick glance to the east he spins a little trinket on his finger and his visage becomes much more menacing why dont you stay a while the obsidian door behind you slams shut id love to have you for dinner ask dragon about trinket its just one of my many possessions a ring with magical powers the black dragon stares at you intently ask dragon about white timbork i havent seen or heard of him in quite some time you must be from amylya id recognize that dull expression anywhere my cousin and i terrorized the valleys in your province a few centuries ago ahhh to be young again the dragon stares into space and reminisces ask dragon about black i keep to myself i spend my days admiring my treasures relaxing and eating the occasional dragonslayer he grins and eyes you menacingly the black dragon stares alternately at you and his little trinket ask dragon about red i think helspeth would prefer that i dont talk about her shes a very private dragon apparently there has been an antidragon sentiment building up in the kingdom of raif the dragon looks somewhat disturbed and says eat a few princesses and they never let you forget ask dragon about jewel how do you know about that the black dragon says looking quite alarmed that is our family jewel and you will never have it the black dragon appears to be getting quite aggravated the black dragon flaps his wings and the current nearly knocks you over read book you flip through the book and come to the section on the fabled dragons of the sixth layer it states that there are three fearsome dragons in this part of the underworld that must be challenged before the jewel can be obtained the first is the white dragon which lives in a cold and icy lair his deadliest weapon is a cone of frost that can freeze an entire army dead in their tracks he is the oldest and wisest of the dragons the black dragon is another fearsome opponent his breath weapon is a stream of acid that can corrode the toughest of metals not to mention bone and skin the oracles have sensed that he is a rather lazy dragon and is content to count his baubles rather than concern himself with otherworldly affairs the final dragon and fabled keeper of the jewel is the fearsome red dragon she is the strongest of the dragons and breathes an indefensible blast of fire which will incinerate anything it touches the red dragon is merciless she will always prefer to attack first and ask questions later if theres anyone left to answer although these dragons have never been viewed the oracles are reasonably sure of these facts because of years of meditation and mystical incantations they also seem certain that reaching the red dragons lair by conventional methods if this is in fact possible will require overcoming three separate hurdles the black dragon yawns in apparent boredom x lye lye is a baseic industrial strength cleaner that can actually be quite corrosive if ingested the black dragon looks into the room to the east then back at you x coat youve read about rare coats such as this from magical textbooks the proper name for this coat is a coat of many colors and its an extremely powerful magic item the magic comes from the coats ability to take on all the properties of any inventory item that you possess you can do this by inserting any item that you have into the coat the coat will absorb the item into its fibers and will then be made up of all the properties that the original inventory item was made up of so for example if you inserted a piece of steel into the coat the magic would produce a full length coat made of steel not bad if you need some armor quickly and cant afford to buy it be cautious however the coat can only absorb one time it would take an incredible amount of power to rip the original item from the coats fibers and once an item has been absorbed its lost forever i remember when the underground used to be bubbling with life the goblin horde was in charge of excavation the kobolds made capable servants and the orcs provided security i must have eaten an adventurer twice your size every day the dragon salivates a bit as he stares in your direction put lye in coat you insert your lye into the coat of many colors and the coat instantly changes texture and color to match that of the lye you now have a coat composed of the elements that made up your lye so have you run into timbork the white dragon yet obviously not there wouldnt be much left of you if you had he can be somewhat uncivilized at times unlike myself of course z time passes the black dragon sizes you up and says be completely honest how do you think youd taste with a clove of garlic and some parsley z time passes the black dragon spreads his wings stretching his back out in the process z time passes the black dragon looks into the room to the east then back at you z time passes the black dragon yawns in apparent boredom z time passes ive had enough of your annoying presence its been a while since ive had the pleasure of eating a meddlesome adventurer with that the dragon opens his mouth and spews forth gallons and gallons of corrosive acid the acid splashes onto your coat and much to your relief doesnt corrode through the lye in your coat is a strong base and the acid is effectively negated by the power of the lye when the dragon finally stops spraying youre left standing in a puddle of salt and water the two products created when an acid is mixed with a base the dragons expression is one of shock how in the world did you survive the blast youve successfully negated his acid attack but his claws and tail still look like potential threats your score has just gone up by five points attack dragon with sword the dragon is still in shock after witnessing your resistance to his acid you catch the dragon in a rare moment of confusion and run forward to attack it you swing your trusty sword as hard as you can and chop off one of the dragons claws unfortunately you shatter your sword in the process the dragon screams in pain as the claw dissolves into a mucky goo the dragon convulses in pain as blueblack blood spews from its severed claw your score has just gone up by two points southeast at the top of the ramp youve scrambled up onto the apex of the ramp unfortunately its a dead end and the only means of escape is back down the ramp huge boulders sit precariously on this ledge through the boulders you can see the black dragon nursing his severed arm and looking up at you while plotting his next move your score has just gone up by two points push boulders what a great idea you put your shoulder into pushing one of the boulders over the ledge because of the boulders weight this normally would be next to impossible but because these boulders are positioned on the edge of the ledge a gentle nudge is all they need after a few seconds you manage to push one of the bigger boulders off the ledge it rubs another boulder on its descent and starts a chain reaction avalanche that cant be stopped when the dust settles there are no boulders left on the ledge and the black dragon lies trapped under tons and tons of rock your score has just gone up by three points northwest black dragons lair the humbled dragon lies under a ton of rock and debris his soft cushiony head and one clenched claw are all that are visible in the pile show crossbow to dragon please dont kill me ill do whatever you ask the black dragon stares at you intently dragon give ring to me the dragon ponders your question looks at your crossbow and says here take it its a ring of heat resistance and may be valuable in your travels please just leave me be the black dragon groans in pain your score has just gone up by two points i you are carrying a ring of heat resistance jacobs travelling sack being worn and open an air bladder a firebug the book of the dragons a coat of many colors being worn arianas crossbow an arrow some spongy moss the black dragon swings its head from side to side in an apparent daze wear ring you put on the ring of heat resistance the black dragon surveys his surroundings dragon open door yes of course ill let you free just please leave me alone and with that the dragon mumbles a few words and the obsidian door to the west opens wide the dragon looks directly at you he checks over all of your possessions and his gaze becomes transfixed on your crossbow he seems to be getting a little nervous ask dragon about jewel the dragon ponders your question looks at your crossbow and says the jewel is protected by helspeth the red dragon if you agree to spare my life i will take you to her reaching her lair by any conventional methods is impossible you will have to sit on my head as i take you through a secret passage

points sit on dragon you cautiously climb the dragons scaly face and sit on the cushiony part between its ears you aim the crossbow at the dragons head just in case it tries something needless to say youre a little nervous the dragon picks itself out of the rubble and heads east black dragons antechamber your eyes bug out as you enter this room theres gold to the right of you silver to the left and all sorts of unimaginable treasures just waiting to be discovered youre sitting on top of the black dragon the black dragon hobbles around with only three of its four major appendages still intact a platinum bar sticks out amongst the scattered treasures a piece of paper with some intricate writing on it can be seen on the floor a featureless white cube lies tucked away under some bullion a copper statue leans up against one of the walls z time passes the black dragon stares up at the ceiling and the surrounding walls z time passes the black dragon spreads his wings as if he were preparing for something z time passes without warning the black dragon takes to the sky he heads right for the ceiling and in fear you close your eyes and brace yourself for impact after a few moments pass without pain you reopen your eyes the ceiling must have been an illusion the dragon is now standing in an expansive eastwest passage welllit passage the huge passage runs eastwest and phosphorescent mosses keep it well lit this tunnel was apparently professionally carved out of molten rock you can tell because of the exactness of the angles and the evenness of the floor and walls youre sitting on top of the black dragon the black dragon hobbles around with only three of its four major appendages still intact z time passes the black dragon sniffs the floor looks east and then west z time passes the black dragon hobbles on to the west steep cliff face the eastwest passage ends at a steep cliff face made of black stone the cliff falls a good twenty or thirty feet but there appear to be a number of handholds leading down the face youre sitting on top of the black dragon the black dragon hobbles around with only three of its four major appendages still intact z time passes the black dragon looks over the edge of the cliff z time passes the black dragon spreads his wings and glides down to the base of the cliff red dragon gate in front of you stands a huge gate made of solid lava the gate bears the insignia of a mighty lizard engulfed in flame this must be the home of the red dragon you can also see a cliff face that leads up and to the east youre sitting on top of the black dragon the black dragon hobbles around with only three of its four major appendages still intact z time passes the black dragon touches the insignia on the gate with his one good paw z time passes the black dragon says some words under his breath and the lava gate opens z time passes the black dragon cautiously proceeds through the door to the west red dragons lair this is it the final confrontation you find yourself in a hollowedout piece of pure magma the air smells of sulfur dioxide and you cough lightly as you breathe it in a river of lava can be seen through a gap to the south and a river of water flows to the north a narrow strip of land divides the two rivers as the room continues west to a plateau over which a wooden chandelier hangs the black dragon takes a few tentative steps into the room and then freezes covering the entire west wall at the end of this cavern is the beautiful red dragon she looks at you with anger and disdain rasha why have you brought this human into my inner ssssanctum screams the red dragon helspeth please i beg your forgiveness i had no choi whimpers the black dragon but he is quickly cut off ssssilence dispose of this human immediately screams the red dragon with that rasha throws you off his head awestruck by the sheer size of the mighty red dragon you are unable to react you fall on the ground and get up to see the black dragon staring at you menacingly your score has just gone up by two points west on the divide you are midway between the entrance to this cave and the plateau that the red dragon currently sits on to the south flows a river of lava while to the north flows a river of water to the east you see the black dragon limping in anticipation and to the west you see the mighty red dragon sitting under her chandelier looking increasingly agitated z time passes the black dragon and red dragon look directly at each other they stare for half a minute and then focus their attentions on you z time passes the black dragon peers at you and opens his mouth z time passes the black dragon spews forth his corrosive black acid and it splatters all over your coat of many colors this dragon must have taken one too many blows to the head that trick didnt work the first time did he think it would work a second time z time passes the black dragon continues to spew forth his acid the copious amounts of acid coming into contact with the lye in your coat are creating gallons and gallons of water that seep directly into the river to the north out of the corner of your eye you notice the water levels in the river getting quite high z time passes the black dragon must be exhausting his lifetime supply of acid as he continues to spray you with the black goo the reaction with the lye is again creating more water and the river level continues to rise to the north the red dragon appears to have had enough she opens her mouth in preparation z time passes the black dragon exhausted of his acid supply slumps over by the east wall unfortunately you get no respite from the attack the red dragon breathes in and blows out a huge fireball that engulfs the entire chamber including you and the black dragon the blast sends shudders through the cavern and small cracks begin to appear by the eastern wall from which the river flows fortunately youre wearing your heat resistant ring and suffer no ill effects z time passes the red dragon increases the intensity of the fireball the flame turns from a bright orangeyellow to a deep red you dont feel the heat from the blast but the sheer force of the fireball almost knocks you over the cracks around the rivers east wall grow bigger and chunks of rock start to fall into the river z time passes the red dragon lets loose with every ounce of energy that she has the flame turns from a deep red to a bright blue the intensity from the blast is so strong that it knocks some of your possessions out of your hands and into the river while incinerating others all of this despite the fact that your ring should protect you and your possessions from the heat you can also feel a tingling in your jacket as you realise that the lye is being ripped from your coat you stare at the coat incredulously as it reverts back to the way you found it in the white dragons lair the eastern wall from which the river flows finally gives way under the combined pressure of the heat and the higher water levels in the river the eastern part of the room begins to flood and the badly burned and exhausted black dragon gets caught up in the overpowering current and is swept away once the red dragon stops breathing her flame she collapses having expended almost all of her energy your score has just gone up by ten points west red dragons plateau a huge piece of molten rock juts out here forming the plateau that the red dragon usually lies on a river of lava can be seen to the south and a river of water to the north high up above the plateau hangs a beautiful wooden

embers in coat you insert your burning embers into the coat of many colors and the coat instantly changes texture and color to match that of the burning embers you now have a coat composed of the elements that made up your burning embers north in the river youre bobbing up and down like a buoy in the ocean subject to the whim of the strong river current the water is surprisingly cold but fortunately you have your air bladder to keep you afloat z time passes the river begins to push you towards an opening in the western wall the water is surprisingly cold as it splashes up against you z time passes you clumsily cling to your air bladder as the current pushes you closer to the western exit z time passes you pass by the red dragon as she lies helplessly under the fallen chandelier she looks right at you surprisingly her look is not one of anger or disdain but one of pity as you ponder the red dragons peculiar reaction the river carries you through the western wall into an underground river youre bobbing up and down in a river of cold black water even your glowing hands dont light up the area as much as youd like the current is still pulling you west and the water feels even colder than before your score has just gone up by two points z time passes although you know that the water in the river is incredibly cold right now you feel quite warm thanks to your newly configured burning embercoat of many colors z time passes you continue to be pulled along by the rivers current toward an opening in the western wall a light can also be seen at the end of the tunnel the water here is still quite cold and becoming quite choppy fortunately youre nice and warm thanks to your coat of many colors z time passes the current becomes extremely violent in this area you hold onto the air bladder with all of your remaining energy as you tumble through the dangerous rapids the waves rush over you in a never ending torrent of water and pressure there are times when you lose sight of the surface and are completely immersed by the black water but you refuse to let go of the bladder just when you feel like you cant hold on to the bladder any longer it gets swept out from underneath you and continues its journey down the river fortunately for you the rough currents deposit you on a grainy beach just north of the river pebble beach this small beach is made up of

you feel like at the moment youd think that the timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for discovering that morbius brain had been secretly kept alive but that you were instrumental in destroying the revived villian do they offer you their gratitude no they merely point out that you left the brain of morbius on karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to gallifrey thats gratitude for you however as you value your own freedom you really dont have much choice but to do as the timelords request at least they gave you the coordinates for karn but you did notice that they refused to give you return coordinates for gallifrey saying youd receive them once youd procured the brain so much for gallifreyan hospitality your thoughts are interrupted as you

of a mountain rocky outgrowths stand like walls all around you a trail through the rock is visible to the east while another trail to the northwest leads farther up the mountain the tardis sits reassuringly nearby against the western rockface stands a massive boulder northwest mountain trail you are on a grim trail that winds itself upwards along the mountain to the northeast a clearing lies to the southeast and a stoney trail leads upwards to the west northeast mountain trail the trail continues up the mountain to the east and downwards to the southwest east mountain trail the trail continues up the mountain to the northeast and downwards to the west to the south some steps are carved into the mountain they lead upwards out of sight up ruins you stand before a huge pile of stone rubble and charred debris you recognize this spot to be the site of solons castle the castle appears to have been completely destroyed you sense a slight psychic twinge in the air this looks like the work of the sisterhood some stone steps lead back down the mountain search ruins searching through the rubble you find a scalpel your score has just gone up by five points get scalpel taken put

towering walls of rock to the southeast lies a trail and there is light coming from the west west bottom of cliff youre at the bottom of a cliff that towers menacingly above you merging with the murky sky above a narrow cleft runs into the cliff base to the east you can see the battered remains of a hideously disfigured creature at the base of the cliff x creature you recognize this corpse to be the battered remains of the body created for morbiuss brain by the brilliant but insane neurologist solon its a horrific conglomeration of the parts of several different creatures quite unattractive instead of a head however there is a plastic globe which acted as an artificial braincase x globe its a transparent plastic globe rather like a fish bowl when morbius brain was housed in it you could almost read his thoughts only now do you suddenly notice the absence of the brain within the case you search around the base of the cliff but find no sign of the brain of morbius looking inside the globe you notice that the nerves which connected the grotesque body to the brain have been carefully severed with a laser cutter somebody has been here before you and stolen morbius brain east narrow

you are standing before a large murky lake which stretches to the east as far as the eye can see the lake water has a greenish tinge and seems to glow somewhat in the dim light a steep slope leads

seemly fashion despite some puzzling conjunctions of joints you discover that interlocking skeletons of dragon and phoenix form the centerpiece in a battle older than bone says one story the dragon

maintained the strictest secrecy few outside of our order know of our existence we are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe it has always been thus we watch over all of quendor never interfering in the affairs of others yet striving to maintain harmony z time passes brother joseph continues speaking but we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay magic as we know it is dying the dreaded age of science is already upon us and in short time our order will be discovered and the balance will be no more many of

today to say that although we cannot protect the future of quendor we can protect ourselves he holds the rod of the ancients high this holy rod which the ancient ones used to defeat the demon anabais

up index in history book there appear to be notable entries on trophy zilbo griffspotter diablo ogre and silvermane look up trophy in history book apparently in gue duncanthrax grew increasingly withdrawn at this time of foremost importance to him was his collection of various battle trophys and awards he had bestowed to himself for unusual valor on the field of battle over the years he decided to construct a hidden underground chamber south of egreth to sequester this collection which would be locked in a most clever means he decided to order the construction of a fourroom key which when a miniature trophy was inserted and removed once in a special keyhole in each of the four rooms in a specific order would unlock a holding chamber in a center room containing his prized trophies priding himself on his logic skills he requested that two captured foreigners produce a logic puzzle plainly inscribed in the four key rooms themselves that would detail the exact order that the key rooms were to be applied a prevaricon who could not help but write untruths was given a can of gold paint while a veritassi who could only write the truth was given a can of silver paint imagine

races has been called the myth of the four brothers by elder kroonwatz the famous royal chronicler the story states that at the dawn of time four evil gods who were brothers sought dominance over that which would become our world great battles were fought between forces of light and darkness and these brothers were often victorious fortunately for us they could not cooperate with each other and fought amongst themselves in petty power struggles driven individually by power and greed indeed legends state that on occassions the brothers would seek ways to actually destroy their own siblings along with the forces of good one brother constructed a strange artifact that would have given him great power but was discovered by agents of good he was imprisoned within the very object he built the remaining three facing certain defeat without the combined strength of their trapped brother fled into planes unknown but made a pact that if the brother were ever freed and the artifact of power returned to him the four would agree to make their final attack against the forces of good kroonwatz points out the obvious parallels with various other mythologies that foretell the end of the known

eons ago in the face of great evil i sought also those ancient spheres that the four ancients never had the chance to use against the evil four elemental demons but alas i could not find them all and sequestered those which i did with good people that the elemental evil could not touch alas my quest has ended here i lie trapped here with the pieces of the true rod in hand unable to go forward trapped by the elemental mystic locks on the rod that prevent it from leaving this very room yet unable to go back to leave the rod here and deny the very real danger of the defeat of the ancients of

only the strangest feeling something is there but no reaction no nerve pulse feels normal as you look down on your body you see only a haze like those of the shadows around you a cascade of red colour explodes below you x shadow they are sometimes stationary sometimes moving around their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place only to appear from nothing in a new place apparently at random although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy suddenly there is a new element in your dream one you have never experienced before a sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you there is nothing visually different about it but you cant bear looking at it for very long x shape in your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate the shadow disappears somewhere a slave under someone elses will you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before roof the city below you is ancient dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear starfilled sky you are standing on the roof of a tower built of crumbling masonry which seems to be centuries old an iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down pull railing the railing wont budge but one of the statues breaks of in your hands x statue in the stone the artist has carved a hideous monster it is vaguely humanshaped but the arms are too long the skin is covered by scales and the fangs are definitely out of place down the winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower study dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic dreamy forms the walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner close to a staircase which leads further up and down the tower is a massive table made of black stone a doorway leads to a smaller room to the south on the desk is a yellow paper x paper on the paper is a coded message and it is impossible to say even in which language the text is written take paper taken x table the base of the stone table is covered with carvings each showing different kinds of creatures or maybe gods standing on stone tables humans who seem to be reciting prayers or spells are standing in front of the creatures you spot something behind the table pushing the cobwebs aside you reveal some writing crudely painted on the stone wall with black paint x writing it seems to be a poem or chant the language is unfamiliar and complicated and you repeat the syllables with a low voice yaingngah heelgeb fai throdog even as you speak you sense something approaching the light in the room darkens and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away a shape appears on the previously empty table as the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man lying still on the table your score has just gone up by five points x man the unconscious man is young tall and white you guess he could be of british descent the most striking thing about him is his clothes which looks at least eighty years out of fashion touch man after several attempts you manage to shake the man awake he sits up on the table still confused in response to your many questions the man simply states that he cant remember and it seems that he is suffering from amnesia x books you browse through the library but cant find any books written in a language you can read so you leave them alone the man gets up from the table and looks around perplexed i think ive been here before he mutters x dust the dust is everywhere the man asks who you are you tell him about your dream and how you ended up here x desk the desk is well used and the surface has many scratches and stains of ink the man falls silent for a while and then he says some parts of my memory have come back now i remember that my name is charles bristow and i studied archeology and history in new england something terrible happened but of that i can recall only small fragments he looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice my god where am i will my nightmares never end down hall this damp hall occupies the whole ground level of the tower a staircase provides access to the higher levels while a massive oak door set in the southern wall leads out charles comes walking behind you x door the door is big and made of crude oak logs which have darkened to almost black with time and wear the lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique charles tries to open the door and says its locked do you know where the key is up the winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower study charles comes with you south storage this is a minor storage chamber connected to the study through a doorway in the northern wall there are some shelves mostly vacant here on one of the shelves are four small vials each neatly labelled and containing some green powder charles follows you take vial randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf charles picks up a vial i saw this before in a dream he says and puts it back take vial randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf take vial randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf charles is lost in thoughts north study charles comes walking behind you down just as you descend the last steps of the staircase you notice that something is wedged between the door and the door frame hall charles comes with you stand on charles you explain your idea for charles and he lifts you up after a few moments of nervous search your fingers touch cold metal you jerk it out and charles puts you down again the fruit of your effort is an iron key your score has just gone up by three points unlock door with key you unlock the oak door open door you open the oak door south before a dark tower this area in front of an old tower offers a nightmarish view over a monstrous tangle of dark stone buildings most buildings are elliptical built of irregularsized basalt blocks of irregular size none of them seem to have any doors or windows there is a square further down to the southwest the sole passage to the tower is through the door to the north charles comes walking behind you x tower judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old it towers high above the nightmarish city below charles looks nervously around southwest public square there is a large public square here surrounded by the same strange elliptical buildings on all sides except to the east where a high wall built of massive sandstone blocks stands there is a road to the west leading deeper into the city against the sky you see a high tower to the northeast the only trace of life comes from the south where a road leads to what appears to be a temple charles comes with you x sandstone the wall is running in northsouth direction it is constructed of huge sandstone blocks and must be more than twelve feet high x temple the temple is an impressive and forbidding structure adorned by mysterious mural paintings many people have gathered inside and muffled sounds of praying can be heard even from the outside charles is lost in thoughts ask charles about temple look at the carvings and the strange shape of that building i know well what that temple is housing it is a house of worship of the evil gods dont go there if you value your life west road wandering through the deserted city you stumble upon something unexpected a large crack yawns darkly into the side of one of the ponderous elliptical buildings to the north you wonder what monumental forces could have effected this rupture the road extends to the east and west charles comes walking behind you x crack the crack is just wide enough to squeeze through charles sighs deeply and says will i ever see miriam again to himself north squeezing through the crack you manage to enter the building a dark hallway the building is of great size and decorated with extreme elaborateness giving you a glimpse the nameless past the walls are covered with mural carvings whose interpretation escapes you the smoothness of the sheer stone walls is interrupted by a crack that gapes into the southern wall a doorway to the north leads deeper inside the building charles comes walking behind you x carvings the carvings shows picturesque patterns and figures but you have a feeling that they are not meant for decoration instead they make you think of illustrations in works of physics and mathematics charles studies the wall and says nice carvings but i dont understand what they mean north library this is an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groining rise indefinitely into the murky shadows overhead the exposed stonework features mural carvings in curvilinear designs vast shelves of dark wood line the walls but they are all empty although deserted the place has the air and the feel of a big library the main exit is to the south charles comes with you x carvings a shout of surprise stops you in your tracks charles is standing in a remote corner looking down at something you move closer and find a skeleton lying partly hidden in a niche x skeleton the yellowed remains lie face down on the floor still covered by torn clothing its bony hand is clutching a note charles points at the skeleton and says poor fellow i hope we dont end up like him take note taken charles is lost in thoughts x note a message is written in spidery script on the note i must be brief because there is not much time left the fever is burning in my body and i think i wont survive the night the caelestae horriblis has answered many of my questions i know of the evil gods of the past i now understand that the barbaric rites in the temple have raised them from their eternal sleep and that it is only a question of time before they reconquer earth when this happens we are all doomed our only hope is to reimpose the ban once set upon the evil gods by the eternal ones a sacrifice on which a mystic symbol is written with holy powder is necessary to summon them hidden in the cryptic language of the caelestae horriblis were the ingredients for this powder and i gathered them in my hideout i have searched for the exact shape of the mystic symbol but this knowledge has been denied me my time is running out but i know that people from earth are sometimes thrown into this dimension and my last wish is that someone can continue where i failed and prepare the sacrifice show note to charles charles looks at the note and suddenly grows pale mother of god he whispers and drops the note on the floor it is my handwriting x skeleton the yellowed remains lie face down on the floor still covered by torn clothing charles is lost in thoughts x torn clothes the skeleton is dressed in the torn remains of a tweed jacket and cotton trousers take book taken x book a forbidden book of ancient lore unfortunately written in latin which you cant read one thing of interest is that the title caelestae horriblis and the authors name abtin mukhtar have been written both in arabic and latin letters x vial when you compare the writing on the label with the name written in the caelestae horriblis you discover a vial labelled mukhtar your score has just gone up by two points x mukhtar apart from it being labelled mukhtar it looks identical to the other vials and contains some green power charles is lost in thoughts south a dark hallway charles comes walking behind you south road charles comes walking behind you west crossroads the road to the public square way back east forks into a northsouth road here to the west looms yet another of the stone buildings charles comes walking behind you north road the ceaseless blandness of the surrounding architecture has a dimly sinister suggestiveness and you cant but help but wonder who the primal entities which rear or reared here are the road leads north deeper into the city charles comes with you south crossroads charles comes with you south dead end this part of the town is radically different from the parts closer to the tower the roads are narrower and the paving is irregular sometimes stone slabs and sometimes cobblestones the buildings are tall but less well kept than before there are still no windows or doors but there are a few overhead bridges from house to house the road ends here and the only way out is to the north a cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges charles comes walking behind you x cat the cat is almost completely white only a spot on its tail is black it is sitting on an overhead bridge and looks frightened charles says oh god im so tired of this i only want to return home the cat says meow x slabs the paving consists of stone slabs and cobblestones it is in bad repair i used to have a cat you know charles remarks the cat says meow search slabs one of the stone slabs seems out of place kicking it emits a hollow sound much like there was some cavity below it the cat looks down at you move slab you push the stone slab aside revealing a entrance to a staircase leading down into darkness the cat looks scared down stairs you are the top of an staircase leading down into darkness a few steps above is the opening through which you can return to the city charles arrives and looks around with a puzzled expression he seems to hesitate briefly and then says look i know that this must sound insane but ever since i came here i keep getting the feeling that i have seen this place before like in a dream or in a distant past that i have almost forgotten down charles looks down the stairs and says gravely dont ask me how but i just know that if i go down there i wont return alive go ahead if you have to but i will stay here and wait for you in the almost complete darkness the stairs seem endless but you finally arrive to a corridor far below the city corridor the staircase to the south opens into a wide corridor reaching further north one both side massive walls rise culminating in massive vaults on which carvings are just visible the floor is strewn with fallen blocks sand and detritus of every kind behind and above a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside x carvings the stone is badly fragmented and the carvings almost gone x blocks they are just shapeless fragments of stone north corridor this is a cyclopean northsouth corridor ten feet wide paved with octagonal and square blocks and solidly vaulted overhead a side passage once led west but it has collapsed north chamber you are in a round vaulted chamber about fifty feet across the black masonry suggests that this might be a room under one of the mysterious buildings in the city the chamber is bare and undecorated two corridors lead from this room one to the south and one to the east looking up also reveals a square opening in the ceiling in the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor it is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands seeing the trapdoor suddenly gives you an unexpected feeling of fear and suggestions of some special peril x trapdoor the trapdoor is carefully sealed with metal bands which look strong its size corresponds to the opening in the ceiling above and it is possible that it might lead to similar chamber below east corridor this is a badly heaped eastwest corridor it is almost completely dark but you can make out a chamber further east in the north wall is the entrance to a cavedin corridor east you struggle through the debris rock chamber this is a black chamber directly cut in the rock crystals embedded in the walls reflect and magnify the available light there is an antique gas stove mounted in one of the walls and a rack just above it the sole exit leads west into a dark corridor the chamber seems ancient but the furniture feels more recent someone must have been using this chamber not so long ago you can also see a chair and a wooden chest which is closed here x stove it is an old gas stove which can be turned on by turning a switch on the stove is a kettle the gas stove is currently switched off x kettle the kettle is empty x rack the rack is mounted on the wall above the stove on the rack are some red powder some yellow powder and a glass bottle inside which is a clear liquid x chest it is a big and heavy wooden chest you cant see inside since it is closed west corridor west you struggle through the debris chamber in the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor it is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands south corridor south corridor behind and above a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside south stairs you can also see charles bristow here ask charles about chest i just have this brief memory of seeing a crowbar in an underground chamber somewhere up dead end a stone slab has been moved revealing a dark entrance leading down a cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges charles comes walking behind you north crossroads charles comes with you east road charles follows you east public square charles comes walking behind you south road an endless array of indistinguishably drab stone buildings lies at either side of the road though humbled by the sheer magnitude of the other buildings a distinctive templelike structure catches your eye at the south end of the road flickering light emanates from its high and narrow windows casting uncertain shadows on the murals that adorn its wide doorway charles follows you x mural the murals decorating the main entrance to the temple are hard to interpret some humans are engaged in what appears to be a ritual one is bringing a tray with something on it to a table and the others are standing a few paces behind holding long knifes charles looks at the temple and says i think that the tower and the temple are more recent than the city itself the style is quite different dont you think listen from inside the temple sounds of chants and prayers are heard but the are too muffled to make out clearly south temple the temple is an immense building whose vaulted ceiling towers high above it is scantily lit but a stage is set in its southern part on the stage there is a huge statue whose appearance is frightening even from this distance in front of the statue is a roughly cubeshaped black stone table there are lots of people in front of the stage and the air is filled with sounds of chants and prayer the main exit is to the north charles follows you there is some commotion as a man is led up to the stage by a few persons who force him onto the stone table and ties him down x huge statue the huge statue on the stage is indeed grotesque and frightening it is vaguely humanshaped but the arms are too long the skin is covered by scales and the fangs are definitely out of place a hooded priestly figure carrying a dagger approaches the victim on the table without further ceremony he stabs the man in the chest people around you start chanting terrible hymns in a foreign language you notice suspicious glances from people close to you charles whispers that it is better to leave before the crowd get too suspicious and leaves the temple north you manage to slip out unnoticed road you can see charles bristow here north public square charles comes walking behind you northeast before a dark tower charles comes walking behind you north hall charles comes walking behind you up the winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower study charles comes walking behind you put mukhtar on table you put the vial labelled mukhtar on the black stone table read writing once again you read the syllables of the chant aloud yaingngah heelgeb fai throdog the green sand emits a faint glow which quickly assumes an unbearable brightness when the light finally dissipates the vial is gone nothing seems to have changed yet you detect something alien in your mode of thinking the sight of the writing evokes strangely uncommon thoughts a stream of incomprehensible thoughts floods your brain as if an alien presence was occupying your mind you are unsure whether to attribute it to fatigue or to insanity your score has just gone up by five points x paper a deep feeling of frustration in projected into your brain this soon gives away to a concentrated study of the papers one sentence is revealed then another before long mukhtar has decoded the message and you are swept away in a powerful vision dark chamber this is a small chamber with rough walls cut directly from rock there is a fireplace set in the wall and a doorway leading west you can see an old man here the man seems to be at work he puts a handful of yellow powder in a bowl your score has just gone up by five points x old man you see nothing special about the old man the man puts some red powder in the bowl he then put the bowl on the fire z time passes the contents in the bowl turn black the man uses the black powder to paint a complex symbol much like a epsilon character onto his chest the scene abruptly changes temple you are in a huge building whose vaulted ceiling towers high above it is scantily lit but a stage is set in its southern part on the stage there is a huge statue whose appearance is frightening even from this distance in front of the statue is a roughly cubeshaped black stone table there are lots of people in front of the stage and the air is filled with sounds of chants and prayer z time passes there is some commotion as a man is led up to the stage by a few persons who force him onto the stone table and ties him down the man is the same old man you saw in the dark rock chamber a few moments ago z time passes a hooded priestly figure carrying a dagger approaches the victim on the table people around you start chanting terrible hymns in a foreign language with increased fervour at every passing instant the priest lifts a sacrificial dagger over the mans body the congregations hideous howling rises to a crescendo of inhuman ferocity and then the dagger dives hungrily into the flesh the huge statue explodes in a brilliant flash of light and violent tremors begin shaking the ground blinded by panic the cultists begin a hopeless race to the exit running shrieking cursing and shouting but their fate has been sealed deep cracks root through the marble ceiling which plummets on the writhing mob with a resounding crash the next moment the vision is gone study dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic dreamy forms the walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner close to a staircase which leads further up and down the tower is a massive table made of black stone a doorway leads to a smaller room to the south although nothing can be seen you feel the presence of mukhtars mind here you can also see charles bristow here x mukhtar although nothing can be seen you can easily feel the presence of abtin mukhtars mind here his mental images interfere with yours x writing you glimpse an alien world with two moons where hideous creatures lurk in the shadows x horriblis you feel a sense of pride of a work well done mixed with a feeling of deep fear charles is lost in thoughts x statue in an instant you glimpse the statue only that it is alive in some dark cavern the monster is sitting among a pile of dismembered bodies chewing on a piece of leg down hall charles comes walking behind you south before a dark tower charles follows you southwest public square charles follows you west road charles follows you west crossroads charles comes with you south dead end a stone slab has been moved revealing a dark entrance leading down a cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges charles follows you down stairs charles comes with you down in the almost complete darkness the stairs seem endless but you finally arrive to a corridor far below the city corridor behind and above a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside north corridor north chamber in the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor it is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands

powder into the kettle take red powder taken put red powder in kettle you put the red powder into the kettle take kettle taken put kettle on stove you put the kettle on the gas stove turn on stove you switch the gas stove on the contents in the kettle change to black then suddenly there is a small explosion whose sound echoes through the underground chambers the sound dies away and for a moment everything is quiet but then you can hear a brief shrill whistling sound moments later loud banging is heard from the corridor to the west culminating in a prolonged screeching sound as though of metal being ripped apart your score has just gone up by two points draw symbol on me like the man in the vision you use the black powder to paint a symbol on your chest take bottle taken there is a repetition of that frightful alien whistling you heard before west corridor there is a wind here that was not present before not merely a cool damp draught but a violent purposeful blast belching frigidly from that corridor leading to the round chamber with the trapdoor west you walk towards the round chamber and glimpse something which makes you retreat to the corridor in panic there is a thing there a blasphemous parody of life a grotesque and eldritch mass of sharp teeth blank scales and a multitude of lidless eyes x thing from this distance you see but a shadow in the darkness ahead but the brief glimpse you got will haunt you in the years to come throw bottle at thing the bottle hits its target and the creature stumbles back in the darkness an earsplitting crash reverberates through the corridors and for a moment you are blinded by an acrid and blinding green cloud the rumbling slowly dies out and from the underground chamber you hear a nasty slopping sound like as of something soft being dragged along a hard surface the sound becomes more and more distant as the monster disappears in the abyss whence it came your score has just gone up by three points west you struggle through the debris chamber the round chamber is badly damaged and the south wall has partly collapsed spreading debris over the floor the metal seals have been forcibly thrown open and the trapdoor yawns open a strong stench emerges from within the dark opening the eastern corridor and the ceiling with its square opening has escaped the worst of the destruction but the entrance to the southern corridor is blocked by rocks and boulders yell you scream from the top of you lungs and receive a faint reply it is charles who has overcome his fear to search for you he starts digging from his side and after much hard work you have cleared a passage however even your combined effort isnt enough to move one heavy stone which is protruding into the tunnel and making it too narrow to crawl through south the tunnel would be big enough to crawl through if it werent for the massive stone protruding into it charles tugs at the stone which wont move an inch z time passes z time passes charles calls to you from the other side of the rocks it is no use we need a tool get the crowbar you protest that you havent seen any crowbar and charles responds that he distinctively remember seeing a crowbar in a chest in an underground chamber where he put some personal papers for safekeeping he also says that the key is hidden under the stove east corridor east you struggle through the debris rock chamber you can also see a chair and a wooden chest which is closed here look under stove just as charles said you find a small brass key pushed deep in under the stove you would never have found it if you didnt know where to look unlock chest with brass key you unlock the wooden chest open chest you open the wooden chest revealing a crowbar and a photograph take all from chest photograph removed crowbar removed x crowbar you see nothing special about the crowbar x photograph the black and white photograph has faded with time but you can still make out a young woman in a long dress standing by the shore west corridor west you struggle through the debris chamber move stone with the crowbar you get enough momentum to finally force the heavy stone aside opening enough space to crawl through south on hands and knees you crawl through the tunnel to the corridor corridor charles falls into your arms delighted to see you again he says that when he heard thunderous noise he felt that you were in danger and decided to come looking for you you wonder how he could know about the crowbar and he replies that it was just one of those memory glimpses that he has been experiencing since he came here show photograph to charles charles takes the photograph and exclaims my photograph of miriam i though it was lost forever south corridor behind and above a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside charles comes with you south stairs charles follows you up dead end a stone slab has been moved revealing a dark entrance leading down a cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges charles follows you throw iron key at cat the cat jumps aside to avoid the projectile but moves a bit too far it falls down but like most cats it escapes unhurt the cat runs off to the north the wrought iron key falls down again charles notices the symbol painted on your chest and exclaims that must be the symbol of the eternal ones ive never seen it but i have read about it after a moment of silence he adds well that should protect you against the evil gods but what will happen to me take iron key taken north crossroads charles comes with you east road charles comes with you east public square a cat probably the same you saw on the overhead bridge before emerges from the shadows the cat suddenly perks his ears and looks towards the wall for a moment he only stands listening then his tail starts waving and he runs towards the wall alerted by the cat you hear a faint sound as if someone was scratching on the other side of the wall charles comes walking behind you listen to wall the sandstone wall it sounds like someone is scratching on the other side of the wall charles says when do you think those who built this city moved out five hundred years ago or more the cat is creeping along a certain section of the wall x wall the sandstone wall the wall is running in northsouth direction and is more than twelve feet tall the cat is obviously interested in a part of it but there is nothing that makes this section stand out but wait isnt there a faint outline of a door almost perfectly cut into the wall the cat is clawing at the wall x door the door is cut out of sandstone and crafted with great care to be almost impossible to make out from the rest of the wall unless you know where to look the cat is trying to insert a paw between the sandstone blocks of the wall open door you push the secret door open revealing a dark passage leading east through the sandstone wall the cat darts forward into the passage and disappears in the shadows east entering the shadowy passage you find yourself in a short corridor ending at drapery pushing it aside gives you entrance to a cavernous hall deserted hall you find yourself in a immense hall faintly illuminated by rays of light falling from an opening in the distant ceiling the far corners are all shadows and the purpose of the hall is hard to guess a strange device is standing in the middle of the room charles comes with you x device the device consists of a high metal column crowned by a cluster of glass bulbs it is obviously manufactured with great care and the lever on its side suggests that it is a machine of some sort x column it is simply a tube of metal about six feet wide and twenty feet tall there surface is absolutely smooth only slightly soiled by oxidation x bulbs the glass bulbs are fitted in an intricate pattern at the top of the metal column way out of reach x lever the huge lever is mounted at the base of the column pull lever a sputtering is heard from the machine growing to a whine terminating in a drone at the same time the bulbs go on increasing their luminosity until they assume a pale blue colour z time passes charles is lost in thoughts suddenly from the farthermost shadows a sound softly drifts towards you z time passes close to the machine a cloud of white vapours appears quickly growing denser and taking a round shape floating just above the floor it keeps getting bigger z time passes the round cloud is hanging just above the floor and getting denser and bigger by the second z time passes charles looks nervously around as the cloud gets bigger and denser it starts glowing from within then in the centre of the cloud confused pictures appear before your eyes flashes of star filled skies unrecognisable shapes both alive and otherwise and blurred images of templelike halls soon give way to a view of a beautiful young lady standing on a busy market street miriam charles exclaims that girl is miriam my fiance and this is the main street in my home town he runs towards and into the glowing cloud in the cloud you now see charles running up to the girl he takes her hand to the dismay of the passersby and talks excitedly with her your score has just gone up by five points enter cloud the scene with charles and his fiance abruptly dissolves before you have a chance to enter the cloud and another picture can be seen it is night and the only light comes from the stars and two braziers which you can see from some distance people are gathered around the braziers maybe the machine is affecting your senses because the picture appears brighter and closer you now see that there is a black monolith between the flaming braziers and that the silent crowd of people appearing as barbarians some clad only in hides of wild beasts all have their eyes fixed on the top of the stone your attention is caught by some commotion at the base of the stone a young boy stark naked and bound hand and foot is pushed upwards by two men there something grabs the boys head and starts pulling him quickly shifting your gaze you stare at disbelief at the creature now squatted on the top of the monolith which only moments ago was empty it is a huge monstrous lizardlike thing with four green blinking eyes the apparitions wide gap is opened ready to devour the poor boy when it suddenly becomes tense it lifts its head and the four eyes stare at you pull lever the light bulbs immediately go out and the drone of the machine slowly dies out the cloud quickly dissolves into thin vapours of smoke west you make your way back to the city public square south road south temple the audience is now facing the hideous statue and everyone is quitely praying z time passes after finishing their prayers the people once again crowd in front of the stage z time passes there is some commotion as a man is led up to the stage by a few persons who force him onto the stone table and ties him down z time passes a hooded priestly figure carrying a dagger approaches the victim on the table without further ceremony he stabs the man in the chest people around you start chanting terrible hymns in a foreign language you notice suspicious glances from people close to you z time passes the priest pulls out something presumably the heart from the victim he starts chanting in haunting triumphant tones that reverberate through the hall the audience below joins him in a sinister ululation a few paces away people start whispering z time passes the priest puts the heart in a bowl in front of the huge statue the body is carried away by some assistants a man starts moving towards you z time passes the man grabs you one look is enough to convince him that you are an outsider you are roughly pushed up on the stage where assistants push you down on the stone table and tie you down stage from the stage you can see the northern part of the temple and the many spectators who observe all that takes place here dominating the stage is a huge statue made of black stone in front of the statue is a table there is a smell of death in the air and the table the statue and the floor are covered in fresh blood z time passes a

time to interview marcilax after the show when complimented on his performance marcilax modestly informed this reviewer that his success was partly due to the setting itself to quote him this very theatre seems to be a storehouse of mystical energy normally when an abundance of mystical energy is centred in one place it will condense into crystals of immense powers but here in this theatre it seems to be dispersed into the very walls however one must still be careful if i was not protected by the enchantments weaved into my protecting medallion my very soul could be in jeopardy anyway

hesitation the horse continues north along the trail across clear creek and then northeast toward blind canyon as the horse makes the last turn into the canyon beetlebaum startles at the sight of something up ahead on the trail at this point you and the horse go your own separate ways beetlebaum falls to the ground quickly regains his footing and continues his journey north to shelter you on

that really catches your eye is the stump of a thumb on his right hand yuh see now you kinda spoiled my shootin with your little tricks yuh know its pretty damn hard for an old guy like me tuh make a livin without a good shootin hand but i learned yah i learned to use muh other hand sure the boys laughed a spell bout it but i done showed em just like i is goin to show yuh beetlebaum yuh know i waited quite a spell for this day yuh see no one could figure what happened to yuh but i waited yup i knew wed cross paths again and here we both be me with muh guns yous with nothin sounds pretty fair to me as soon as you blurt it out echoes of beetlebaum fill the canyon wait time passes well nuff of this jawin better say your prayers missy the sound of a galloping horse fills the canyon wait

eyes are filled with rage his nose flared and thick white foam spews from his mouth just as beetlebaum lowers his head for a full charge george screams out in an earsplitting yell here comes beetlebaum black thad out of reflex goes for his right gun first to shoot the charging horse his thumbless hand fumbles the gun around and then drops it to the ground in an instant but an instant too late he goes for his other gun with his good hand beetlebaum with his ears back plows into black thad like a freight train black thad is launched into the air from the collision and slams into the canyon wall what life may have been left in black thad is certainly concluded by the ensuing rockslide after the dust clears a little george stares at you for a moment and says i just knew youd be the one to clean up around these parts heck when i tricked ol frank into goin above to rile yuh up i could just feel it in mah bones beetlebaum get yer miserable hide over here as beetlebaum saunters over still wet with sweat george opens the saddlebag and takes out a blue gumball and hands it to you go on get on home i dont take to no goodbyes from no woman george pauses and then breaks out in a big smile and chortles ah heck ya done good hell ya done great is cant thank ya enough fer helpin out lets get some grub and get ya on yer way after a pleasant meal of beans and jerky you say your goodbyes to the old cowboy following a long hug and a quick peck on the cheek you finally partake of the blue gum quicker than an instant you find yourself press space to continue  on the floor you are lying on the floor staring at the ceiling your head feels surprisingly good considering your previous antics in fact you feel quite refreshed from your hiatus from consciousness your score has just gone up by thirty points stand up you pass the sentry watching the doorway to the yi control room hardly aware of his presence and step inside stopping before the owner of the familiar frowning face just inside your escorts come to a halt behind you tolan the tall wiry woman says to you you steel yourself for the need to speak cheryl you reply dig leader cheryl thadafel i knew you would have need of the greatest mechanist in the galaxy again the longest speech ever to cross these lips tolan this is going to be on my terms or not at all you turn your empty hands faceup cheryl this is important to me it is the yilonomordel whatever the restrictions i cannot miss this opportunity especially if the restrictions required you be kept away from it enough i dont have much else to work with here do i as she dismisses the guards you sweep your eyes about the room again this time you will pull it offregardless of cheryls desires the weapon an interactive misdirection copyright sean barrett release serial number inform vvs library stb yilonomordel control room most humans would probably find it the height of fashion but this low ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and sterility the featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered a cluster of forms sits in the center atop the slightly concave floor cheryl thadafel stands here watching you closely type about for special information about interacting with the weapon touch notch you touch the the notch with a minimal pressure it is cooler than the rest of the slab and you can feel the heat from your finger being drawn out momentarily where no cracks had been visible before nevertheless sections of the top of the slab give way and a control surface slides up and clicks into place cheryl says ok this is interesting she peers at the control surface x studs each of the thousands of studs arrayed in a regular hexagonal packing across the control surface has a color and shape but those two together are not enough to make each unique however it resembles all the other yi mechanisms you have encountered in your life although nobody else in the galaxy might ever realize it the third axis of encoding is in the electric potential of the stud although the human body is poorly suited to the task your long study has made you sensitive to this dimension as well with that extra information and your encyclopedic knowledge of yi technology you can hazard a guess about many of these controls there are a number of studs whose exact function you are fairly certain you would recall if you studied them more closely and which seem relevant right now an information stud a powerup stud a project status stud a sequence stud and a forcefield stud cheryl says whats on that screen she approaches from other side of the slab bah see if you can find some text there x information stud activating this stud will bring up a large display on which will be shown what you imagine must be a detailed description of the purpose behind yilonomordel and information on how to use itnone of which would do you any good since you can not read yi writing you are not certain that this is the information it displays but you did activate and then deactivate this stud several months ago so you are quite positive about it being full of yi text x powerup stud activating this stud should power on and off all the major systems needed to use yilonomordel touch powerup stud you touch your fingertip gently against the powerup stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it hmm absolutely nothing happens given the years of disuse perhaps the generator is in need of minor maintenance you search the control surface and find a generator access stud which should give you access to the generator so you can make any repairs necessary x project status stud activating this stud ought to produce some sort of more detailed display of the yilonomordel status knowing the way the yi tend to compartmentalize knowledge it will hopefully not give any detail about the point of the entire mechanism x generator access activating this stud should give you access to the fusion generator used to power this facility x sequence stud activating this toggle stud will most likely bring up a concise listing of the steps needed to use yilonomordel on the control surface viewscreen it probably has text that cheryl could decipher but hopefully it includes symbolic instructions despite your bravado yilonomordel is on a vastly different scope that any other yi technology you have worked with and youll need help getting it goinghelp you can not rely on cheryl for unfortunately cheryl seems to be able to see the viewscreen pretty clearly x forcefield stud you are no coward but you know when you can use some help so you always have an eye open for something like this activating this stud probably turns on a forcefield generator around the control slaband yi forcefields are nearly impenetrable by human technology this might come in handy if cheryl was not always so close to the slab touch information this is the only stud you were able to activate when you were here before and you are positive that it will produce the information cheryls looking forwhich would make her bring todays session to a halt it might be enough information for her to figure out what this place is if so youd never get a chance to try again so you better not activate it unless youve got some way to stop her touch generator you touch your fingertip gently against the generator access stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it a pale green energy appears on the monitor hologram cheryl says whats that dont touch to the right a white pillar with an elliptical crosssection slides up out of the floor cheryl says you better know what youre doing here tolan reply you say im looking for the manual override x white pillar this looks to be the fusion generator it is an elliptical white pillar almost two meters tall one meter wide and half a meter deep on the long front side is an access panel which is closed cheryl says well of course id help but im busy watching you reply you say of course touch panel you touch your fingers to the access panel and immediately recognize the subtle flow of energy through the surface how much easier this would be if you could see in the electromagnetic spectrum after a moment of concentration you align the energy in your fingertips against the flow the access panel swings open revealing a fusion generator bay cheryl says what exactly is that reply you say it is a wiring crossover terminal something is not connected correctly x bay the fusion generator bay is a spherical chamber which houses several yi components you recognize comprise a plasma generatora much bigger generator than you have ever seen in your long lifewhile the one remaining mechanism must be a plasma containment systemsomething you have always suspected the yi were capable of despite it being beyond your species ability to produce closer inspection of the containment system reveals twelve contact points you recall noticing a tool stud which might give you something useful for analyzing the situation cheryl says oh right i should have recognized it x contact points the twelve contacts are arranged around the edge of the plasma generation zone in perfect symmetry they all look quite identical touch tool stud you touch your fingertip gently against the tool stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it a slot appears on the top of the slab to the left rising out of the slot is an electropulse probe cheryl says what is that hands off tolan she grabs it as it emerges wait time passes cheryl says you can have this once im sure its safe tolan she examines the probe carefully then aims it so neither end is pointing at either of you and fiddles with it for a moment although you cannot see anything happening directly cheryls monitor hologram lights up with a multicolored iridescent sphere which slowly fades away cheryl says huh just an electromagnetic toy she sets it down on the slab take probe taken x probe a thin cylindrical halfmeterlong rod the electropulse probe is a common yi device for working with certain kinds of yi technology the subtle interplay of electric and magnetic fields found in mechanisms can be stimulated with the probe useful for detection analysis or calibration at one end are two control sensors ask cheryl for hologram cheryl says this monitor hologram is how im keeping tabs on you if i dont have it youre not going to get to do anything anything at all cheryl thinks for a moment and then speaks again however i recall we confiscated a pair of electromagneticsensitive goggles from you back when we found you here she speaks into her communicator several minutes later one of the guards stands in the doorway and tosses the goggles on the floor next to you then leaves wear goggles first taking the electromagnetic goggles you clumsily struggle to put on the electromagnetic goggles and the room suddenly bursts to life visually whorls and eddies of energy play over every surface of the room but the window although it is a far cry from being able to directly perceive this much of the electromagnetic spectrum it is far far more than you have been forced to live with for some time the one drawback is that it is difficult to read displays since the display spectrum is compressed to such a narrow band and the display circuitry itself is exposed x generator the white pillar the fusion generator is an elliptical pillar with small amounts of energy playing over it energy flows in a regulated way across an access panel which is open revealing a fusion generator bay cheryl sighs tolan do you have any idea how important it is we figure this place out once and for all x bay the fusion generator bay houses several yi components you recognize comprise a plasma generator while the remaining mechanism must be a plasma containment system the containment system has twelve contact points there is little energy flow to be seen since the generator is off cheryl says the problem is with the lono as you might guess probe contacts you put the electropulse probe into the fusion generator bay you trigger the top sensor a sharp multicolored burst of electromagnetic radiation pulses out of the tip of the probe the contact points in the fusion generator bay resonate in responseall but the ninth one which stays utterly black there is probably a recalibration stud for each of the contacts amongst the giant array of controls on the slab it is a good thing you got the goggles the probe flash tends to overwhelm the details on cheryls hologram anyway cheryl says theyre coming back tolan soon we think so before they show up im going to have found a way to put an end to it with your help press bottom you trigger the bottom sensor and the ambient electromagnetic activity in the probe increases significantly cheryl says you probably never realized it tolan but the yi had a somewhat high opinion of themselves the word yi isnt just their nameit means the end or the ultimate the yilonomordel isnt the yis lono weapon its the final lono weapon they were planning to win their war with it wait time passes cheryl says so i guess ill finally make it into the history books by doing it for them touch calibration timing your action carefully you touch your fingertip gently against the calibration stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it a sharp multicolored burst of electromagnetic radiation pulses out of the tip of the probe the contact points in the fusion generator bay resonate in response you are confident it will power up now take probe taken shut panel you close the generator access panel press powerup you touch your fingertip gently against the powerup stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it the fusion generator pillar radiates a sequence of colors dark red deep purple light blue and then builds and peaks with a very bright yellow cheryls monitor hologram reveals significant electromagnetic activity beginning to occur within the fusion generator it looks like powering up was a good place to start that was fairly obvious but you have no intuition about what to do next with a mechanism on this scale the grid of stud offers thousands of studs any of which could plausibly be involved cheryl says youre making quite a bit of progress tolan press project status stud you touch your fingertip gently against the project status stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it projected on the left half of the far wall of the room an installation status display showing the current configuration of yilonomordel appears on the installation status display the indicator corresponding to this asteroid changes color cheryl says whats this she takes a step closer to it shoot no text remove goggles you take off the goggles revealing the drab world of the natural human visual spectrum x status display the installation status display uses crisp simple geometric symbols to display a representation of the entire yilonomordel installation the star system you are in now with the twenty asteroids including this one orbiting it and the twenty stars arrayed around it like the vertices of a dodecahedron each with twenty asteroids of their own the indicator corresponding to this asteroid is glowing brighter than those for the other asteroids cheryl says i cant imagine how you can stand wearing those bulky things of course they make a huge difference in what you see x indicator the installation status display shows a symbolic representation of the entire yilonomordel installation the star system you are in now with the twenty asteroids including this one orbiting it and the twenty stars arrayed around it like the vertices of a dodecahedron each with twenty asteroids of their own the indicator corresponding to this asteroid is glowing brighter than those for the other asteroids x studs there are a number of studs whose function you are fairly certain of and which might prove relevant a calibration stud a tool stud a generator access stud an information stud a powerup stud a project status stud a sequence stud and a forcefield stud press status stud you touch your fingertip gently against the project status stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it the installation status display fades away press bottom you trigger the bottom sensor give goggles to cheryl cheryl takes the goggles from you something interesting to see this way tolan she puts them on and looks around as if slightly disoriented press sequence stud you touch your fingertip gently against the sequence stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it the viewscreen lights up with a list of yi text and corresponding control iconography although you cannot see anything happening directly cheryls

viewscreen the viewscreen is a small perfectly square display set into the control surface although you can not understand the yi writing you can recognize a number of the control icons in the sequence powerup then transmit go then control rods then ignition powering up you have done no doubt there are studs to trigger the other three press sequence stud you touch your fingertip gently against the sequence stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it the viewscreen returns to its normal display cheryl says is that it she reaches up to take off the goggles x studs there are a number of studs whose function you are fairly certain of and which might prove relevant a transmit stud a control stud an ignition stud a calibration stud a tool stud a generator access stud an information stud a powerup stud a project status stud a sequence stud and a forcefield stud cheryl says shows over huh she takes off the goggles and tosses them on the ground beside you good thing theyre sturdy enough to take a fair amount of abuse x transmit stud activating this stud no doubt transmits a signal of some sort presumably to the other asteroids in the yilonomordel installation considering their ability to miniaturize the yi would not need an external transmission source the transmitter is probably right inside the slab however given the location and energy necessary the signal it produces will surely be visible on cheryls monitor hologram or through your electromagnetic goggles put probe in slab you put the top end of the probe back into the slot leaving the sensors exposed the probe is held in place firmly but sticks up out of the slot touch bottom you trigger the bottom sensor touch tool stud you touch your fingertip gently against the tool stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it the probe sinks into the slot which closes over it touch transmit stud timing your action carefully you touch your fingertip gently against the transmit stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it cheryls monitor hologram lights up with a burst of radiant energy from the probe and from the transmission both interfering with each other and masked by the surroundings of the control slab an icon on the viewscreen changes subtly cheryl says tolan my superiors dont want you anywhere near here if they find out ill be in a lot of trouble touch control stud you touch your fingertip gently against the control stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it a pair of rods slowly emerge from surface of the slab cheryl says what are those x rods a pair of slender cylindrical control rods sticks up from the surface of the slab through a thin crack the rods are about a meter apart you have never seen anything like this in your experience with yi equipment cheryl pull rods cheryl says id rather leave my hands free to reach for my laser tolan but i guess you can take the handcuffs off she tosses the key to the handcuffs onto the floor next to you take key taken unlock handcuffs with key you unlock the handcuffs remove handcuffs first opening the handcuffs you take off the handcuffs pull rods you pull the rods together towards each other and they move until they are much closer an icon on the viewscreen changes slightly the rods want to spring back apart and you can not do anything else while holding them together so you release the rods put handcuffs on rods you pull the rods together and slip the handcuffs on them they seem to hold the rods together quite handily an icon on the viewscreen changes slightly cheryl says how clever press information you touch your fingertip gently against the information stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it a large display appears on the right wall of the room filled with line after line of yi text cheryl notices the activity and turns to look at the display thats it youve found it wonderful she walks over to take a closer look at it oh tolan i think the first word is humans i think this might be addressed to us the first ever communication from the yi press forcefield you touch your fingertip gently against the forcefield stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it cheryl notices the activity on her hologram monitor she turns to face you tolan youre a dead man i told you not to mess with anything she draws her laser pistol but hesitates hell thats a yi forcefield isnt it well you cant stay in there forever press ignition you touch your fingertip gently against the ignition stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it on cheryls monitor hologram an enormous surge of energy flows out of the fusion generator and out in all directions around the room cheryl looks at the monitor hologram in dismay then turns to face you cheryl says what are you up to tolan reply you say well it has been fun cheryl but it is over now cheryl says what do you mean a speaker at the doorway crackles to life dig leader some time ago we detected a transmission to the surrounding asteroids and have just determined it came from the control room reply you say yilonomordel is powered up and ready to go cheryl says ready what is yilonomordel reply you say it is the yis ultimate weapon just like you said you remember the lono planetbuster yilonomordel is more far more it is a galaxy smasher i think i believe i hope cheryl stares at you silently reply you say we can only assume the yi did not use it because they did not want to wipe out humanity along with the lonoat least not if humanity managed to stop the lono reply you say so now i will get to do the honors cheryl says what destroy the galaxy why the voice on the speaker returns also a freighter in the area reports a signal was sent out to the neighboring stars reply you shake your head cheryl cheryl come now why do you think i would want to destroy all of humanity cheryl says i know you too well to believe youre a psychopath so i dont know reply you say you do not know me at all cheryl i am different from everyone you know different from every human being in the galaxy in fact differently motivated reply you say did your superiors suspect did they tell you to keep me away or did they tell you to kill me tell me cheryl considers replying but hesitates reply you say never mind it matters not reply you say well enough discussion i find it hard enough to control this pathetic human body without forcing myself to try to make human speech say goodbye milky way press

west of the junction where the rockbound passage widens out into a large flat area although the land here is barren you can see vegetation to the west south of here is a mighty wall of stone ancient and crumbling to the southwest the wall has decayed enough to form an opening through which seeps a thin mist a trail dips sharply into rocky terrain to the northwest west cliff this is a remarkable spot in the dungeon perhaps two hundred feet above you is a gaping hole in the earths surface through which pours bright sunshine a few seedlings from the world above nurtured by the sunlight and occasional rains have grown into giant trees making this a virtual oasis in the desert of the underground empire to the west is a sheer precipice dropping nearly fifty feet to jagged rocks below the way south is barred by a forbidding stone wall crumbling from age there is a jagged opening in the wall to the southwest through which leaks a fine mist the land to the east looks lifeless and barren a rope is tied to one of the large trees here and is dangling over the side of the cliff reaching down to the shelf below it seems as if somebody has been here recently as there is some fresh bread lying beneath one of the other trees get bread taken east barren area east junction standing before you is a great rock imbedded within it is an elvish sword east damp passage this is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards you can see a crossroads to the west and two nearly identical passages lead east and northeast a stone channel wide and deep steeply descends into the room from the south it is covered with moss and lichen and is far too slippery to climb the channel crosses the room but the opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble northeast engravings room

something to happen give bread to old man he looks up at you and takes the waybread from you slowly he eats the bread and pauses when he is finished he starts to speak perhaps what you seek is through

conditions to the east are poor where the lake turns into swamp the west and south shores are suitable for walking however down underwater you are below the surface of the lake it turns out that the lake is quite shallow and the bottom is only a few feet below you considering the frigid temperature of the water you should probably not plan an extended stay the lake bottom is sandy and a few hearty plants and algae live there out of the corner of your eye a small shiny object appears in the sand a moment later it is gone get amulet the shiny object slips from your grasp and back onto the floor of the lake where it is covered in sand you catch a brief glimpse of something shiny in the sand get amulet you reach the shiny object it is a simple golden amulet the icy waters are taking their toll you will not be able to hold out much longer you run out of air and return to the surface on the lake west western shore you are on the western shore of the lake the ground here is quite hard but a few sickly reeds manage to grow near the waters edge the only path leads into the rock to the south south scenic vista you are in a small chamber carved in the rock with the sole exit to the north mounted on one wall is a table labelled scenic vista whose featureless surface is angled toward you one might believe that the table was used to indicate points of interest in the view from this spot like those found in many parks on the other hand your surroundings are far from spacious and by no stretch of the imagination could this spot be considered scenic an indicator above the

able to hold out much longer you run out of air and return to the surface on the lake south southern shore you are on the south shore of the lake rock formations prevent movement to the west and thickening swamp to the east makes the going all but impossible to the south where the beach meets a rock formation you can make out a dark passage sloping steeply upward into the rock south it is pitch black you are likely to be eaten by a grue spray repellant on myself the spray smells like a mixture of old socks and burning rubber if i were a grue id sure stay clear south there are sinister gurgling noises in the darkness all around you it is pitch black the ground continues to slope upwards away from the lake you can barely detect a dim light from the east east key room you are between some rock and a dark place the room is lit dimly from above revealing a lone dark path sloping down to the west to one side of the room is a large manhole cover the light from above seems to be focused in the center of the room where a single key is lying in the dust get key taken move cover the cover is moved a bit to one side revealing a small hole leading into darkness that horrible smell is much less pungent now down aqueduct you are in a wide stone channel part of the water supply system for the great underground empire the source of water was a waterfall to the south which has long since dried up water flowed along the aqueduct to the north this region is lit from above although the source of light is not apparent north high arch you are now on one of the tallest arches of the aqueduct hundreds of feet above a rocky chasm the immensity of the aqueduct project is apparent from here stone supports rise from the rock floor to form massive arches which traverse the region from north to south the watercarrying channel here is wide and deep to the west and far below you can make out a balcony which must command a wide view of the aqueduct north water slide you are near the northern end of this segment of the aqueduct system to the south and slightly uphill the bulk of the aqueduct looms ominously towering above a gorge to the north the water channel drops precipitously and enters a rocky hole the damp moss and lichen would certainly make that a oneway trip north damp passage there is a torch here get torch taken west junction standing before you is a great rock imbedded within it is an elvish sword west barren area west cliff down cliff ledge this is a rockstrewn ledge near the base of a tall cliff the bottom of the cliff is another fifteen feet below you

is within your reach a large chest closed and locked is lying among the boulders wait time passes wait time passes at the edge of the cliff above you a man appears he looks down at you and speaks hello down there you seem to have a problem maybe i can help you he chuckles in an unsettling sort of way perhaps if you tied that chest to the end of the rope i might be able to drag it up for you then ill be more than happy to help you up he laughs again tie chest to rope the chest is now tied to the rope the man above you looks pleased now theres a good friend thank you very much indeed he pulls on the rope and the chest is lifted to the top of the cliff and out of sight with a short laugh he disappears ill be back in a short while are his last words wait time passes there is a great

starts to smile broadly he disappears for an instant and the massive door opens without a sound the old man motions and you feel yourself drawn toward him i am the master of the dungeon he booms i have been watching you closely during your journey through the great underground empire yes he says as if recalling some almost forgotten time we have met before although i may not appear as i did

the newfound areas of the great underground empire in your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurers brass lantern in the other is an ersatzelvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever its plastic blade dull as a bread knife barely reflects the lanterns dim and uneven glow northeast as you enter the tunnel you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepesoled boots as you turn to look back up to the exit giant translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling you duck and cover your head when the dust clears you feel your heart sink in your chest you

the cultural center of the gue is adorned in the ghastly style of the gues grotesque period with leering gargoyles cartoonish friezes depicting longforgotten scenes of gue history and primitive statuary of pointyheaded personages unknown perhaps very very distant progenitors of the flatheads the place would have been best left undiscovered north of here a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription convention center to the east under a fiftystory triumphal arch a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the royal theater a relatively small and unobtrusive

precise specifications of lord dimwit flathead its excessive structure holds seats not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the th mezzanine the seats themselves are built like thrones with high wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees a long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the cultural center to the west to the oversized stage to the east in all other directions narrow aisles have been arranged in the maze of twisty passages style that was so popular in dimwits day i would strongly recommend avoiding them east stage the rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind the dead were thought not unreasonably to be dreadfully dull as such it

purpose or that mud refers to a multiuser dungeon of the sort now popular among the bettersocialized members of the adventurer class in the southeast corner of the room a sign reading exhibit closed

who were believed to have created the gue as an act of pure will before you a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood legend has it that so lifelike were these busts that they would seem to talk among themselves discussing history the arts music and philosophy much as those mythic figures did in the golden age of text adventures but years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finelywrought pedestals now alas the only two that remain are those of marc blank and mike berlyn bloodied but unbent battered but unbroken shaken but not stirred worse than the physical desecration of this shrine it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains for now above the busts is a sign reading consult the oracles zorkmids beneath the sign is a coinsized slot mikes eyes like those on a famous sciencefiction adventure game box seem to follow you as you approach marc wake up we have company put coin in slot the coin drops into the slot but unbeknownst to mike and marc remains tied to the tinsel marc looks with some satisfaction at mike then assumes a very serious oracular one might say pose a holographic image of an hourglass miraculously appears beside him the number glowing inside with a harsh red light the number is replaced by as his voice drops three or four octaves now hear the oracle of the implementers he begins the wisdom of the ages he continues in no apparent hurry the revealed truth of all truths he drones the word `truths somehow adding an extra syllable or two and finally listen then snapping out of his trancelike state he looks in your direction rather sheepishly sorry about that he says i get a little carried away just another five zorkmids and ill finish up with a really juicy piece of information he looks at you expectantly marcs bust does a doubletake hmm he hmms not a badlooking specimen though back in the old days they built `em tougher pull tinsel taken mikes bust looks wistful sigh he sighs oh for the olden golden days of yore put coin in slot mike seems surprised and not altogether pleased that youve been able to put the same quintzorkmid coin in twice with a blink of his eye the tinsel goes up in a ball of sparks and flame pyrotechnics being a specialty with him and the coin drops fully into the slot marc assumes the oracular position and intones ahem it may be uncommon knowledge but it should be clear to see that text is not a great threed medium you may be blue but looking through rose colored glasses helps bring things into alignment mike says true marc

a sick twisted and pitiful homage to that special creature as near and dear to my heart as a parser the adventurer there in the center of the room sits a display that sends a shiver up your spine a skeleton on the small pedestal beside it sits a plaque the walls have been clawed the wallpaper and exhibit signs shredded by what was probably an overexcited tourist group of grues in what looks like the remnants of their enthusiastic visit piles of bones lie on the floor cracked open fangmarks clearly evident on their glistening white surfaces one sign on the wall by a door to the southwest remains though the lantern dims a little pry sixth rib with sword click whir zzzzip well as a parser i could give you a huge hint that the door to the janitors closet has just disappeared but dont

earth on the distant foggy horizon the ceiling appears to meet the floor blending in the mist the only thing in this enormous cavernous area are shelves shelves and more shelves all of them empty dwindling into nothingness this of course disproves the ancient belief that theres never enough closet space on the shelves is an aerosol can you think you see the sun duck behind the clouds then

flickers and goes out it is now pitch dark in here shake lamp your rough treatment of the lantern was enough to get it lit again this must be your lucky day the mud forum this large square chamber is certainly messy enough for a mud forum whatever that might be but there is no mud in sight for purposes of argument it could be postulated that the water source for the mud has dried up or that mud was brought in for some scientific purpose or that mud refers to a multiuser dungeon of the sort now popular among the bettersocialized members of the adventurer class in the southeast corner of the room a sign reading exhibit closed danger overlays another sign beneath which is a sealed door on the floor starting near the center of the room four large symbols have been painted in royal purple a

push the button a light shines out from inside the display unit revealing a transparent film lit from below at first a blurred image appears then after a few moments an almost magical threedimensional scene comes into view a man with a flattened head stands in the foreground while directly behind him is a tree behind the tree you can clearly see a house while behind the house hovering off the ground is a hotair balloon oddly the raft appears off to the side as if not in the scene at all after getting a good look you drop the cover and release the button your score has just gone up by ten

agitated as they spy the huge crystals one rushes forward knocking you over in its enthusiasm and tastes the crystalline boulders originally blocking your exit the lead ant starts doing what could be called a dance of joy the others form orderly rows like chorus lines and start moving in time to some unheard beat no doubt led by the leaderant with antennae gesticulating wildly the leader ant quickly and easily lifts one of the boulders as if it were no more than a tiny grain of sugar the others break their formation and one by one take a boulder handed off by their leader and head for their homes before you know it theyve made a hole large enough for you to make your escape from the tunnel southwest
