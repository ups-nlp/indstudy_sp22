room this is the science classroom usually occupied by ms empirious a young science teacher whose strictness and inflexibility are the stuff of middle school legend a note scrawled lightly in pencil beside the door reads abandon hope all you who enter here actually the note has been written so lightly that you probably wouldnt notice it if you hadnt put it there the exit is to the east as you pass through the room doorway judy flashes a shy wave toward weird little ed dibbles a student in ms empirious class hi biff she whispers toward ed adoringly your heart sinks a bitbut your disappointment is exceeded by your incredulity ms empirious is presenting a chemistry demonstration near the front of the classroom not far from the door youve just entered shes standing behind a rather elaborate table with a twentygallon aquarium on top and a set of shelves that she can see and use though the front of the desk hides them from the class now class she says in her formal slightly singsongish voice please remember that like all of our demonstrations this look at the volatile properties of the element sodium is perfectly perfectly safe she removes a large jar with a viscous green substance in it from one of the shelves and places it on the desk for all to see in this jar she announces dramatically we have a few ounces of the very active metal called sodium to keep it from reacting with the surrounding atmosphere we keep it in the jar surrounded by an oily gel using a large pair of tweezers manipulated carefully in her left hand ms empirious lifts a greencoated cube about an inch on each side to the top of the jar next with a small sharplooking scissorlike device held in her right hand she snips off a tiny piece of the cube then she carefully lowers the cube back into the jar and moves the jar back to the shelf in front of her now class when i drop this tiny piece of sodium into the aquarium youll observe a rather violent reaction ms e drops the tiny piece of green covered stuff into the aquarium and sure enough it starts smoking and zooming around the surface of the water finally disappearing with a dramatically loud pop the class apparently loves the show and bursts into restrained but nearly unanimous applause reacting to this rare adulation from students ms empirious picks up a jar containing a greenish cube once again to show it off to the class but most atypically she moves too quickly and rather clumsily she juggles the jar momentarily and then drops it right into the aquarium ms e blesses herself rapidly and looks toward the sky as the class goes silent with terror you can see judy queenie ms empirious ed dibbles and an aquarium in which is a jar here your score has just gone up by one point,take jar,1
after pausing for a second or two to evaluate the situation noting that youre not dead yet you reach into the aquarium with your free hand and pluck out the jar which you notice does not actually seem to be smoking or sputtering at all ms e then bursts into laughter as the class becomes ready to kill her well done doug she chuckles you wouldnt have saved us if that had been a real jar of sodium but it was a brave thing to do anyway now class says the teacher i told you this was perfectly safe didnt i now that you look closely as i always urge you to do you can see that the jar doug pulled from the water is similar to but certainly not the same as the one i used earlier and alls well that ends well now enterprisers you may endeavor to deliver a candy gram or two you hand the ersatz sodium jar to ms empirious,give gram to ed,1
first taking the candygram ed thanks you and winks at judy as you finish making your delivery you notice that ms empirious is moving the original sodium jar from its shelf under the demonstration table presumably to a more permanent storage area you look twice to see whether this is the actual sodium jar but it certainly appears to be the real thing this time incredibly though as she lifts the jar ms e seems to experience a brief fainting spell and drops the jar squarely into the aquarium she blesses herself three times very rapidly and stares wideeyed into the tank the class gasps loudly hoping the end will be quick you decide you might as well repeat your previous heroics but youre half way across the room from the aquarium after your visit with ed nowhere near as close to the demonstration as you were before it takes you a full second or more to get to the front of the room and by that time youve noticed that once again theres absolutely no sign of any smoking or bubbling in the water this time queenie starts chuckling first followed closely by judy and ms e yes class once again you can see that our demonstration was perfectly safe the teacher coos the material you saw buzzing around and popping in the water at the start of the class was not pure sodium which would be too risky for us to keep around here it was actually a mechanical device designed to simulate sodium for chemistry demonstrations like this one so now youve learned and will never forget the highly reactive qualities of sodium and youve also learned to look twice mrs empirious now turns to you thank you enterprisers for your kind and highly alert visit your score has just gone up by one point,east,0

hunter hunterin darkness hunter in darkness a cave crawl by dave ahl jr release serial number inform v library nearly nearly the animal stink is rank and close you raise your crossbow try to peer beyond dark wet stone,cock crossbow,1
you pull down the lever winching the string back until it locks something shifts in the darkness ahead a great silent bulk your prey,shoot prey,1
tunk and you flinch at the hissing shriek that echoes down the cave walls the dark shape retreats scrambling away as your thudding pulse slows moments later barely sensed the scent of blood you have wounded the wumpus,left,1
you advance into the chamber a bat flutters in your face you swipe it away and three more bats replace it you duck swearing swearing again at a sharp nip on your arm drew blood it did there is a rustling all around you you try to remember what you know about the habits of cave bats oh you scramble back covering your eyes too late the swarm is on you harrying you small teeth and shrieks like shards of glass you cannot see you are running stumbling ahead of the storm the wumpus screams too close you thrash flinging something blindly at the new threat and as you recall what else you know of the hunting of bats the floor drops away to nothing beneath you pain,x shape,1
bottom of pit you roll painfully to hands and knees ah your arm nearly gives way you realize you somehow tore hell out of it on the way down or landing its bleeding freely this is the bottom of a wide pit the walls are entirely unclimbable of course the floor is rippled and uneven rising to sharp blades of stone near the edge mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere but theres no standing water so yes a narrow crawl leads down in the far corner a twisted shape lies nearby,take rags,1
the old fiber tears without too much strain you manage to rip loose some strips from the loose hems lying clear of the corpse what remains behind stained with old decay youd just as soon not touch a bat flutters down from overhead and another you wave your arms but theyre keeping their distance,bandage arm with rags,1
the cloth strips you quickly bind up your arm with the cloth it stanches the bleeding at least you only hope that you can get to better care before infection sets in more bats gather,down,0
you kneel stiffly and poke your head into the opening its tight and it looks like it gets tighter ahead no help for it you crawl inside tight crawl youre on your hands and knees in a throat of stone the roof dips even lower ahead if you advance itll be squirming forwards on your belly and squirming backwards will be impossible you think grimly,ahead,1
you hunch your elbows beneath your chest and wiggle forward on them into the gullet tight crawl you stop after a long silent time to rest crawling is hard work you know well and your aching shoulders and scraped knees attest to it but the crawl is no different here than anywhere you have just enough room to raise your head and theres nothing to see ahead but more stone to crawl through,ahead,1
you begin determinedly working yourself forward again tight crawl the rock is lower above you and narrower youre lying full length now your arms stretched out ahead but still rough stone scrapes your shoulders and you seem to be angling a bit downwards icy water is trickling past you your lamp flickers erratically the moisture must be getting to its workings,ahead,1
you continue scrabble with fingers brace arms push with toes youre definitely tilted headdown now is the stone pressing more tightly to either side of you tight crawl you lie on your side gasping trying to recover some strength your back is sore your neck is worse your head aches from cracking into unexpected stone a cold stony knot presses into your left side your right knee you stretch forward once more feeling for a few more inches before you continue splash your fingers are submerged in water,ahead,1
you stretch your hands forward submerging them hunch stretch inchworm inchworm your arms are submerged and water ripples at your chin no room to lift your head you turn your face to the side cheek scraping against the damn everpresent stone and stretch again your lamp flickers once and goes out tight crawl you are lying in cold still water it licks at your cheek and arms and across the backs of your thighs the chill makes your bruised knees and chest hurt all the more your neck screams from craning high enough to breathe but there is no room to sit up no room to turn no room,ahead,1
you struggle on you hope the water grows no deeper that thought occupies you for a few more hunches a few more stretches grow no deeper if the water grows deeper grow no deeper you shake that away and nothing comes to replace it you crawl on in the dark the water grows no deeper maybe its not as deep now tight crawl water trickles over your hands but the floor must have risen there is less of it a note of hope but you cannot see,ahead,1
you thrust your shoulders forward they stick,ahead,1
you push again its just this spot your hands are free in a wider area ahead but immovable stone grates against your chest and shoulders,ahead,1
youve got one shoulder past the edge the other is behind a corner of stone and you cant imagine how its going to get through,ahead,1
you brace your legs as best you can and shove futilely against the trap,ahead,1
you brace your legs as best you can and shove futilely against the trap you are never going to leave this place,ahead,1
you brace your legs as best you can and shove it feels like scraping flesh from bone but your shoulder tears past the edge you lie and gasp for a moment and then work your torso painfully through the gap the passage slants sharply down now but its widening its widening you halfcrawl halfslide downward dragging your legs out of the gap and come to rest in what seems like blinding light exhaustion,ahead,1

the halfmask is the pale almost bluish color of the finest celadon cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry the face in its blank sculpted features has no more personality than newforged steel half a mask thoughthat must mean the left half is,x self,1
the weight of armor and the breath of silk are familiar your face thoughwhen you reach up it is porcelain that meets your touch on the left side and you cannot remove it though neither does it impede your senses it seems the left half is a part of you perhaps no more a mask than a hand is a glove,down,0
shadow armory shadows gather around you for a moment dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf kite comb and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret curiously the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn they are silhouettes flung against the walls stairs carved with basreliefs spiral upward northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen,x light,1

autumn is the maples season when all things die but fire and sun pine and moon last guardians before the door into winter and winters snowlocked court once you knew a darkhaired woman who always wore red gold and black the maples colors even at the emperors winter court steadfast against the encroaching fashions of indigo or palest blue she had a low ironic laugh but she is lost to you here surrounded by stone shadow light there is no indication of the season,x kite,1
there should be two kites not one brothers and sisters fly them as pairs during the kitefighting auguries of spring alas no wind stirs in this dustless place,x comb,1
the comb has the curved tortoiseshell shape that you have seen in years pastbut is one of the teeth broken,x shadow,1

the compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately the cardinal directionsif such they beare marked by hawk swallow crane and feather more curiously still the needle is of glass suggesting that it homes to something other than the north perhaps you can set it yourself the needle points to the feather,x feather,1
even for the emperors winter court the only birds that remain in the gardens are the jeweled nightingales which sing dainty mechanical tunes when they are stroked with a feather your brother hated them passionately but he listened to them readily enough whenever the justiciar asked with that smile that lit her eyes though it never reached her mouth,x hawk,1
it was autumn when last you went hawking with the emperors justiciar freed of court robes she soared as surely as the kestrel that raced before her her hair was black and scandalously unbound as the redandgold ribbons tore away in the wind to land in your waiting hand autumn,x swallow,1

more remarkable than the fans intricate designs is the long blue tassel that trails from it it is the kind of fan a lady might carry to cool herself during the summers heat,cut blue tassel,1
a few neat cuts free some strands from the tassel and tying them together results ina kitestring for a second there is a darkeyed boy beside you whose laugh is yours but wilder whose smile is yours but wider if only you remembered the augury that you and your brother cast that spring in the kiteflying ritual years before either of you met the woman who wore black and red and gold,i,1

spring the season of augury red and black and gold maple colors kite colors you no longer know which a breeze stirs through the room though the trees and flowers are no more affected by it than they would be by the suns earnest light or a plague of locusts nevertheless you hear the hollow sound of something being dislodged from one of the trees it was spring when your kite and your brothers became too entangled for one glassedged string to cut the others for one to conquer the other though entangled they flew yet and spring when you were first parted from your brother on his first campaign and yours two fatherless boys entering the emperors service as adults the kite tugs from your hand as impatient as a hawk winning free of hood dances perilously upward upon the wings of this nowhere breeze and disappears the breeze swells to a gale that rears southward and upward seeking the sky in this enclosed and skyless room,south,0

skeletal banquet it seems this is a banquet room if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes as though they are constellations south lies a chamber of brooding silence and a vague sweet fragrance comes from the east stairs of blackest marble lead downward on the table are a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks,x bones,1
the feast before you seems a mockery for everywhere upon the plates and bowls there is nothing but skeletons artfully pieced together to create grotesqueries from ordinary game a creature halfbird halfrabbit for one or a pheasant with extra legs yet it is perhaps no more grotesque than some of the intrigues that poisoned the emperors court at times,get bones with chopsticks,1
first taking the ivory chopsticks bone calls to bone it seems for the skeletal feast flees no more with great care you disentangle the bones and piece them back together in a more seemly fashion despite some puzzling conjunctions of joints you discover that interlocking skeletons of dragon and phoenix form the centerpiece in a battle older than bone says one story the dragon and phoenix were brothers both born of fire but one ascended to burn in splendor and the other clothed himself in lightning tongue and storm rains the phoenix must die but is ever reborn the dragon lives no more but never dies,down,0
as your feet meet that first step a sudden vertigo overtakes you as though you journeyed through skies beyond imagining across hollow and infinite distances you emerge back where you started it seems the nights hold is too strong here and you must find some guidestar to anchor your way,x arrangement,1
the arrangement is in the shape of the constellation called the white archer who shot the sun out of the sky and wanders the night in penance it seems a curiously illfortuned constellation for an illfortuned feast and almost any other arrangement would be more auspicious,set constellations to horse,1
the moon is the horse that bears the white archers messages to his lover the sun returning to rove the nights passages with him the heavenly horse though is a messenger that submits to no rider like the justiciar with her dark proud eyes it seems a strangely fitting sign for a strangers feast,x arrangement,1

hall of hawks memory overtakes you as you enter you and your brother speaking to each other in low tense voices not shouting never shouting before her until the justiciar bids you leave curtly the next day when the emperor stripped her of her rank and neither you nor your brother had the influence to free her from the courts machinationsyou have lived that day over and over more than any man ought hawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls it is strangely warm here as though fires lived just beyond your perception the entire hall is open to the wind and warmth unobstructed except by your presence stairs of darkest marble circle upward a passageway leads south into clear colorless light,x hawks,1

time passes brother joseph continues speaking our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy few outside of our order know of our existence we are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe it has always been thus we watch over all of quendor never interfering in the affairs of others yet striving to maintain harmony,z,1
time passes brother joseph continues speaking but we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay magic as we know it is dying the dreaded age of science is already upon us and in short time our order will be discovered and the balance will be no more many of our order have gone out into the world in secret in attempts to repair what has been broken but alas this appears to be impossible,z,1
time passes brother joseph continues i have brought you all forth today to say that although we cannot protect the future of quendor we can protect ourselves he holds the rod of the ancients high this holy rod which the ancient ones used to defeat the demon anabais has the power to protect our order i have discovered a lost mystic cube he holds a white featureless cube high in his other hand this cube when joined with the rod of the ancients will preserve our order forever sequestering all of us in another time another place,z,1
time passes there is a momentous pause brother joseph looks at the entire order may the gods smile down upon us on this day we go now into the unknown he triumphantly joins the white cube to the end of the rod of the ancients there is a sudden blinding white flash the chanting is instantly broken by a tremendous thunderclap brother joseph is suddenly thrown back by a great force and to your horror the rod of the ancients breaks apart four pieces now float serenely above the altar above a strange black globe that seems to crackle with energy at last the voice comes from nowhere and everywhere the black sphere pulsates with lightning anabais is free again the voice pauses i see you found my fake mystic cube joseph i knew that someday someone would find it and free me from my prison the voice pauses again to show my gratitude im scattering this broken symbol to the corners of the world the pieces of the rod suddenly disappear watch out someone cries the black sphere suddenly expands with alarming speed seconds later a violent explosion seems to jar the very ground you stand on and a black void covers all you awaken in your room in a cold sweat was it all a terrible dream the day beckons your quarters you are in your room in the monastery it is sparsely furnished but certainly feels like home the exit is north you can see a note and a sleeping pallet here,read note,1

they are sometimes stationary sometimes moving around their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place only to appear from nothing in a new place apparently at random although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy suddenly there is a new element in your dream one you have never experienced before a sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you there is nothing visually different about it but you cant bear looking at it for very long,x shape,1
in your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate the shadow disappears somewhere a slave under someone elses will you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before roof the city below you is ancient dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear starfilled sky you are standing on the roof of a tower built of crumbling masonry which seems to be centuries old an iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down,pull railing,1

it seems to be a poem or chant the language is unfamiliar and complicated and you repeat the syllables with a low voice yaingngah heelgeb fai throdog even as you speak you sense something approaching the light in the room darkens and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away a shape appears on the previously empty table as the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man lying still on the table your score has just gone up by five points,x man,1

you browse through the library but cant find any books written in a language you can read so you leave them alone the man gets up from the table and looks around perplexed i think ive been here before he mutters,x dust,1
the dust is everywhere the man asks who you are you tell him about your dream and how you ended up here,x desk,1
the desk is well used and the surface has many scratches and stains of ink the man falls silent for a while and then he says some parts of my memory have come back now i remember that my name is charles bristow and i studied archeology and history in new england something terrible happened but of that i can recall only small fragments he looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice my god where am i will my nightmares never end,down,0

before a dark tower this area in front of an old tower offers a nightmarish view over a monstrous tangle of dark stone buildings most buildings are elliptical built of irregularsized basalt blocks of irregular size none of them seem to have any doors or windows there is a square further down to the southwest the sole passage to the tower is through the door to the north charles comes walking behind you,x tower,1
judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old it towers high above the nightmarish city below charles looks nervously around,southwest,0
public square there is a large public square here surrounded by the same strange elliptical buildings on all sides except to the east where a high wall built of massive sandstone blocks stands there is a road to the west leading deeper into the city against the sky you see a high tower to the northeast the only trace of life comes from the south where a road leads to what appears to be a temple charles comes with you,x sandstone,1
the wall is running in northsouth direction it is constructed of huge sandstone blocks and must be more than twelve feet high,x temple,1
the temple is an impressive and forbidding structure adorned by mysterious mural paintings many people have gathered inside and muffled sounds of praying can be heard even from the outside charles is lost in thoughts,ask charles about temple,1
look at the carvings and the strange shape of that building i know well what that temple is housing it is a house of worship of the evil gods dont go there if you value your life,west,0
road wandering through the deserted city you stumble upon something unexpected a large crack yawns darkly into the side of one of the ponderous elliptical buildings to the north you wonder what monumental forces could have effected this rupture the road extends to the east and west charles comes walking behind you,x crack,1
the crack is just wide enough to squeeze through charles sighs deeply and says will i ever see miriam again to himself,north,0
squeezing through the crack you manage to enter the building a dark hallway the building is of great size and decorated with extreme elaborateness giving you a glimpse the nameless past the walls are covered with mural carvings whose interpretation escapes you the smoothness of the sheer stone walls is interrupted by a crack that gapes into the southern wall a doorway to the north leads deeper inside the building charles comes walking behind you,x carvings,1
the carvings shows picturesque patterns and figures but you have a feeling that they are not meant for decoration instead they make you think of illustrations in works of physics and mathematics charles studies the wall and says nice carvings but i dont understand what they mean,north,0
library this is an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groining rise indefinitely into the murky shadows overhead the exposed stonework features mural carvings in curvilinear designs vast shelves of dark wood line the walls but they are all empty although deserted the place has the air and the feel of a big library the main exit is to the south charles comes with you,x carvings,1
a shout of surprise stops you in your tracks charles is standing in a remote corner looking down at something you move closer and find a skeleton lying partly hidden in a niche,x skeleton,1
the yellowed remains lie face down on the floor still covered by torn clothing its bony hand is clutching a note charles points at the skeleton and says poor fellow i hope we dont end up like him,take note,1
taken charles is lost in thoughts,x note,1
a message is written in spidery script on the note i must be brief because there is not much time left the fever is burning in my body and i think i wont survive the night the caelestae horriblis has answered many of my questions i know of the evil gods of the past i now understand that the barbaric rites in the temple have raised them from their eternal sleep and that it is only a question of time before they reconquer earth when this happens we are all doomed our only hope is to reimpose the ban once set upon the evil gods by the eternal ones a sacrifice on which a mystic symbol is written with holy powder is necessary to summon them hidden in the cryptic language of the caelestae horriblis were the ingredients for this powder and i gathered them in my hideout i have searched for the exact shape of the mystic symbol but this knowledge has been denied me my time is running out but i know that people from earth are sometimes thrown into this dimension and my last wish is that someone can continue where i failed and prepare the sacrifice,show note to charles,1
charles looks at the note and suddenly grows pale mother of god he whispers and drops the note on the floor it is my handwriting,x skeleton,1

dead end this part of the town is radically different from the parts closer to the tower the roads are narrower and the paving is irregular sometimes stone slabs and sometimes cobblestones the buildings are tall but less well kept than before there are still no windows or doors but there are a few overhead bridges from house to house the road ends here and the only way out is to the north a cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges charles comes walking behind you,x cat,1
the cat is almost completely white only a spot on its tail is black it is sitting on an overhead bridge and looks frightened charles says oh god im so tired of this i only want to return home the cat says meow,x slabs,1
the paving consists of stone slabs and cobblestones it is in bad repair i used to have a cat you know charles remarks the cat says meow,search slabs,1
one of the stone slabs seems out of place kicking it emits a hollow sound much like there was some cavity below it the cat looks down at you,move slab,1
you push the stone slab aside revealing a entrance to a staircase leading down into darkness the cat looks scared,down,0
stairs you are the top of an staircase leading down into darkness a few steps above is the opening through which you can return to the city charles arrives and looks around with a puzzled expression he seems to hesitate briefly and then says look i know that this must sound insane but ever since i came here i keep getting the feeling that i have seen this place before like in a dream or in a distant past that i have almost forgotten,down,0
charles looks down the stairs and says gravely dont ask me how but i just know that if i go down there i wont return alive go ahead if you have to but i will stay here and wait for you in the almost complete darkness the stairs seem endless but you finally arrive to a corridor far below the city corridor the staircase to the south opens into a wide corridor reaching further north one both side massive walls rise culminating in massive vaults on which carvings are just visible the floor is strewn with fallen blocks sand and detritus of every kind behind and above a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside,x carvings,1

chamber you are in a round vaulted chamber about fifty feet across the black masonry suggests that this might be a room under one of the mysterious buildings in the city the chamber is bare and undecorated two corridors lead from this room one to the south and one to the east looking up also reveals a square opening in the ceiling in the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor it is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands seeing the trapdoor suddenly gives you an unexpected feeling of fear and suggestions of some special peril,x trapdoor,1
the trapdoor is carefully sealed with metal bands which look strong its size corresponds to the opening in the ceiling above and it is possible that it might lead to similar chamber below,east,0
corridor this is a badly heaped eastwest corridor it is almost completely dark but you can make out a chamber further east in the north wall is the entrance to a cavedin corridor,east,0
you struggle through the debris rock chamber this is a black chamber directly cut in the rock crystals embedded in the walls reflect and magnify the available light there is an antique gas stove mounted in one of the walls and a rack just above it the sole exit leads west into a dark corridor the chamber seems ancient but the furniture feels more recent someone must have been using this chamber not so long ago you can also see a chair and a wooden chest which is closed here,x stove,1
it is an old gas stove which can be turned on by turning a switch on the stove is a kettle the gas stove is currently switched off,x kettle,1

road an endless array of indistinguishably drab stone buildings lies at either side of the road though humbled by the sheer magnitude of the other buildings a distinctive templelike structure catches your eye at the south end of the road flickering light emanates from its high and narrow windows casting uncertain shadows on the murals that adorn its wide doorway charles follows you,x mural,1
the murals decorating the main entrance to the temple are hard to interpret some humans are engaged in what appears to be a ritual one is bringing a tray with something on it to a table and the others are standing a few paces behind holding long knifes charles looks at the temple and says i think that the tower and the temple are more recent than the city itself the style is quite different dont you think,listen,1
from inside the temple sounds of chants and prayers are heard but the are too muffled to make out clearly,south,0
temple the temple is an immense building whose vaulted ceiling towers high above it is scantily lit but a stage is set in its southern part on the stage there is a huge statue whose appearance is frightening even from this distance in front of the statue is a roughly cubeshaped black stone table there are lots of people in front of the stage and the air is filled with sounds of chants and prayer the main exit is to the north charles follows you there is some commotion as a man is led up to the stage by a few persons who force him onto the stone table and ties him down,x huge statue,1
the huge statue on the stage is indeed grotesque and frightening it is vaguely humanshaped but the arms are too long the skin is covered by scales and the fangs are definitely out of place a hooded priestly figure carrying a dagger approaches the victim on the table without further ceremony he stabs the man in the chest people around you start chanting terrible hymns in a foreign language you notice suspicious glances from people close to you charles whispers that it is better to leave before the crowd get too suspicious and leaves the temple,north,0

the winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower study charles comes walking behind you,put mukhtar on table,1
you put the vial labelled mukhtar on the black stone table,read writing,1
once again you read the syllables of the chant aloud yaingngah heelgeb fai throdog the green sand emits a faint glow which quickly assumes an unbearable brightness when the light finally dissipates the vial is gone nothing seems to have changed yet you detect something alien in your mode of thinking the sight of the writing evokes strangely uncommon thoughts a stream of incomprehensible thoughts floods your brain as if an alien presence was occupying your mind you are unsure whether to attribute it to fatigue or to insanity your score has just gone up by five points,x paper,1
a deep feeling of frustration in projected into your brain this soon gives away to a concentrated study of the papers one sentence is revealed then another before long mukhtar has decoded the message and you are swept away in a powerful vision dark chamber this is a small chamber with rough walls cut directly from rock there is a fireplace set in the wall and a doorway leading west you can see an old man here the man seems to be at work he puts a handful of yellow powder in a bowl your score has just gone up by five points,x old man,1
you see nothing special about the old man the man puts some red powder in the bowl he then put the bowl on the fire,z,1
time passes the contents in the bowl turn black the man uses the black powder to paint a complex symbol much like a epsilon character onto his chest the scene abruptly changes temple you are in a huge building whose vaulted ceiling towers high above it is scantily lit but a stage is set in its southern part on the stage there is a huge statue whose appearance is frightening even from this distance in front of the statue is a roughly cubeshaped black stone table there are lots of people in front of the stage and the air is filled with sounds of chants and prayer,z,1
time passes there is some commotion as a man is led up to the stage by a few persons who force him onto the stone table and ties him down the man is the same old man you saw in the dark rock chamber a few moments ago,z,1
time passes a hooded priestly figure carrying a dagger approaches the victim on the table people around you start chanting terrible hymns in a foreign language with increased fervour at every passing instant the priest lifts a sacrificial dagger over the mans body the congregations hideous howling rises to a crescendo of inhuman ferocity and then the dagger dives hungrily into the flesh the huge statue explodes in a brilliant flash of light and violent tremors begin shaking the ground blinded by panic the cultists begin a hopeless race to the exit running shrieking cursing and shouting but their fate has been sealed deep cracks root through the marble ceiling which plummets on the writhing mob with a resounding crash the next moment the vision is gone study dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic dreamy forms the walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner close to a staircase which leads further up and down the tower is a massive table made of black stone a doorway leads to a smaller room to the south although nothing can be seen you feel the presence of mukhtars mind here you can also see charles bristow here,x mukhtar,1
although nothing can be seen you can easily feel the presence of abtin mukhtars mind here his mental images interfere with yours,x writing,1
you glimpse an alien world with two moons where hideous creatures lurk in the shadows,x horriblis,1
you feel a sense of pride of a work well done mixed with a feeling of deep fear charles is lost in thoughts,x statue,1

in the almost complete darkness the stairs seem endless but you finally arrive to a corridor far below the city corridor behind and above a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside,north,0
corridor,north,0
chamber in the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor it is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands,east,0

you put the kettle on the gas stove,turn on stove,1
you switch the gas stove on the contents in the kettle change to black then suddenly there is a small explosion whose sound echoes through the underground chambers the sound dies away and for a moment everything is quiet but then you can hear a brief shrill whistling sound moments later loud banging is heard from the corridor to the west culminating in a prolonged screeching sound as though of metal being ripped apart your score has just gone up by two points,draw symbol on me,1
like the man in the vision you use the black powder to paint a symbol on your chest,take bottle,1
taken there is a repetition of that frightful alien whistling you heard before,west,0
corridor there is a wind here that was not present before not merely a cool damp draught but a violent purposeful blast belching frigidly from that corridor leading to the round chamber with the trapdoor,west,0
you walk towards the round chamber and glimpse something which makes you retreat to the corridor in panic there is a thing there a blasphemous parody of life a grotesque and eldritch mass of sharp teeth blank scales and a multitude of lidless eyes,x thing,1
from this distance you see but a shadow in the darkness ahead but the brief glimpse you got will haunt you in the years to come,throw bottle at thing,1
the bottle hits its target and the creature stumbles back in the darkness an earsplitting crash reverberates through the corridors and for a moment you are blinded by an acrid and blinding green cloud the rumbling slowly dies out and from the underground chamber you hear a nasty slopping sound like as of something soft being dragged along a hard surface the sound becomes more and more distant as the monster disappears in the abyss whence it came your score has just gone up by three points,west,0
you struggle through the debris chamber the round chamber is badly damaged and the south wall has partly collapsed spreading debris over the floor the metal seals have been forcibly thrown open and the trapdoor yawns open a strong stench emerges from within the dark opening the eastern corridor and the ceiling with its square opening has escaped the worst of the destruction but the entrance to the southern corridor is blocked by rocks and boulders,yell,1
you scream from the top of you lungs and receive a faint reply it is charles who has overcome his fear to search for you he starts digging from his side and after much hard work you have cleared a passage however even your combined effort isnt enough to move one heavy stone which is protruding into the tunnel and making it too narrow to crawl through,south,0
the tunnel would be big enough to crawl through if it werent for the massive stone protruding into it charles tugs at the stone which wont move an inch,z,1
time passes,z,1
time passes charles calls to you from the other side of the rocks it is no use we need a tool get the crowbar you protest that you havent seen any crowbar and charles responds that he distinctively remember seeing a crowbar in a chest in an underground chamber where he put some personal papers for safekeeping he also says that the key is hidden under the stove,east,0
corridor,east,0
you struggle through the debris rock chamber you can also see a chair and a wooden chest which is closed here,look under stove,1
just as charles said you find a small brass key pushed deep in under the stove you would never have found it if you didnt know where to look,unlock chest with brass key,1
you unlock the wooden chest,open chest,1
you open the wooden chest revealing a crowbar and a photograph,take all from chest,1
photograph removed crowbar removed,x crowbar,1
you see nothing special about the crowbar,x photograph,1
the black and white photograph has faded with time but you can still make out a young woman in a long dress standing by the shore,west,0
corridor,west,0
you struggle through the debris chamber,move stone,1
with the crowbar you get enough momentum to finally force the heavy stone aside opening enough space to crawl through,south,0
on hands and knees you crawl through the tunnel to the corridor corridor charles falls into your arms delighted to see you again he says that when he heard thunderous noise he felt that you were in danger and decided to come looking for you you wonder how he could know about the crowbar and he replies that it was just one of those memory glimpses that he has been experiencing since he came here,show photograph to charles,1
charles takes the photograph and exclaims my photograph of miriam i though it was lost forever,south,0
corridor behind and above a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside charles comes with you,south,0
stairs charles follows you,up,0
dead end a stone slab has been moved revealing a dark entrance leading down a cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges charles follows you,throw iron key at cat,1
the cat jumps aside to avoid the projectile but moves a bit too far it falls down but like most cats it escapes unhurt the cat runs off to the north the wrought iron key falls down again charles notices the symbol painted on your chest and exclaims that must be the symbol of the eternal ones ive never seen it but i have read about it after a moment of silence he adds well that should protect you against the evil gods but what will happen to me,take iron key,1

crossroads charles comes with you,east,0
road charles comes with you,east,0
public square a cat probably the same you saw on the overhead bridge before emerges from the shadows the cat suddenly perks his ears and looks towards the wall for a moment he only stands listening then his tail starts waving and he runs towards the wall alerted by the cat you hear a faint sound as if someone was scratching on the other side of the wall charles comes walking behind you,listen to wall,1
the sandstone wall it sounds like someone is scratching on the other side of the wall charles says when do you think those who built this city moved out five hundred years ago or more the cat is creeping along a certain section of the wall,x wall,1
the sandstone wall the wall is running in northsouth direction and is more than twelve feet tall the cat is obviously interested in a part of it but there is nothing that makes this section stand out but wait isnt there a faint outline of a door almost perfectly cut into the wall the cat is clawing at the wall,x door,1
the door is cut out of sandstone and crafted with great care to be almost impossible to make out from the rest of the wall unless you know where to look the cat is trying to insert a paw between the sandstone blocks of the wall,open door,1
you push the secret door open revealing a dark passage leading east through the sandstone wall the cat darts forward into the passage and disappears in the shadows,east,0
entering the shadowy passage you find yourself in a short corridor ending at drapery pushing it aside gives you entrance to a cavernous hall deserted hall you find yourself in a immense hall faintly illuminated by rays of light falling from an opening in the distant ceiling the far corners are all shadows and the purpose of the hall is hard to guess a strange device is standing in the middle of the room charles comes with you,x device,1
the device consists of a high metal column crowned by a cluster of glass bulbs it is obviously manufactured with great care and the lever on its side suggests that it is a machine of some sort,x column,1
it is simply a tube of metal about six feet wide and twenty feet tall there surface is absolutely smooth only slightly soiled by oxidation,x bulbs,1
the glass bulbs are fitted in an intricate pattern at the top of the metal column way out of reach,x lever,1
the huge lever is mounted at the base of the column,pull lever,1
a sputtering is heard from the machine growing to a whine terminating in a drone at the same time the bulbs go on increasing their luminosity until they assume a pale blue colour,z,1
time passes charles is lost in thoughts suddenly from the farthermost shadows a sound softly drifts towards you,z,1
time passes close to the machine a cloud of white vapours appears quickly growing denser and taking a round shape floating just above the floor it keeps getting bigger,z,1
time passes the round cloud is hanging just above the floor and getting denser and bigger by the second,z,1
time passes charles looks nervously around as the cloud gets bigger and denser it starts glowing from within then in the centre of the cloud confused pictures appear before your eyes flashes of star filled skies unrecognisable shapes both alive and otherwise and blurred images of templelike halls soon give way to a view of a beautiful young lady standing on a busy market street miriam charles exclaims that girl is miriam my fiance and this is the main street in my home town he runs towards and into the glowing cloud in the cloud you now see charles running up to the girl he takes her hand to the dismay of the passersby and talks excitedly with her your score has just gone up by five points,enter cloud,1
the scene with charles and his fiance abruptly dissolves before you have a chance to enter the cloud and another picture can be seen it is night and the only light comes from the stars and two braziers which you can see from some distance people are gathered around the braziers maybe the machine is affecting your senses because the picture appears brighter and closer you now see that there is a black monolith between the flaming braziers and that the silent crowd of people appearing as barbarians some clad only in hides of wild beasts all have their eyes fixed on the top of the stone your attention is caught by some commotion at the base of the stone a young boy stark naked and bound hand and foot is pushed upwards by two men there something grabs the boys head and starts pulling him quickly shifting your gaze you stare at disbelief at the creature now squatted on the top of the monolith which only moments ago was empty it is a huge monstrous lizardlike thing with four green blinking eyes the apparitions wide gap is opened ready to devour the poor boy when it suddenly becomes tense it lifts its head and the four eyes stare at you,pull lever,1
the light bulbs immediately go out and the drone of the machine slowly dies out the cloud quickly dissolves into thin vapours of smoke,west,0
you make your way back to the city public square,south,0

temple the audience is now facing the hideous statue and everyone is quitely praying,z,1
time passes after finishing their prayers the people once again crowd in front of the stage,z,1
time passes there is some commotion as a man is led up to the stage by a few persons who force him onto the stone table and ties him down,z,1
time passes a hooded priestly figure carrying a dagger approaches the victim on the table without further ceremony he stabs the man in the chest people around you start chanting terrible hymns in a foreign language you notice suspicious glances from people close to you,z,1
time passes the priest pulls out something presumably the heart from the victim he starts chanting in haunting triumphant tones that reverberate through the hall the audience below joins him in a sinister ululation a few paces away people start whispering,z,1
time passes the priest puts the heart in a bowl in front of the huge statue the body is carried away by some assistants a man starts moving towards you,z,1
time passes the man grabs you one look is enough to convince him that you are an outsider you are roughly pushed up on the stage where assistants push you down on the stone table and tie you down stage from the stage you can see the northern part of the temple and the many spectators who observe all that takes place here dominating the stage is a huge statue made of black stone in front of the statue is a table there is a smell of death in the air and the table the statue and the floor are covered in fresh blood,z,1
time passes a hooded figure wielding a long bloodencrusted dagger emerges from the shadows he walks up towards you raising the dagger over his head,z,1

you touch the the notch with a minimal pressure it is cooler than the rest of the slab and you can feel the heat from your finger being drawn out momentarily where no cracks had been visible before nevertheless sections of the top of the slab give way and a control surface slides up and clicks into place cheryl says ok this is interesting she peers at the control surface,x studs,1
each of the thousands of studs arrayed in a regular hexagonal packing across the control surface has a color and shape but those two together are not enough to make each unique however it resembles all the other yi mechanisms you have encountered in your life although nobody else in the galaxy might ever realize it the third axis of encoding is in the electric potential of the stud although the human body is poorly suited to the task your long study has made you sensitive to this dimension as well with that extra information and your encyclopedic knowledge of yi technology you can hazard a guess about many of these controls there are a number of studs whose exact function you are fairly certain you would recall if you studied them more closely and which seem relevant right now an information stud a powerup stud a project status stud a sequence stud and a forcefield stud cheryl says whats on that screen she approaches from other side of the slab bah see if you can find some text there,x information stud,1
activating this stud will bring up a large display on which will be shown what you imagine must be a detailed description of the purpose behind yilonomordel and information on how to use itnone of which would do you any good since you can not read yi writing you are not certain that this is the information it displays but you did activate and then deactivate this stud several months ago so you are quite positive about it being full of yi text,x powerup stud,1
activating this stud should power on and off all the major systems needed to use yilonomordel,touch powerup stud,1
you touch your fingertip gently against the powerup stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it hmm absolutely nothing happens given the years of disuse perhaps the generator is in need of minor maintenance you search the control surface and find a generator access stud which should give you access to the generator so you can make any repairs necessary,x project status stud,1
activating this stud ought to produce some sort of more detailed display of the yilonomordel status knowing the way the yi tend to compartmentalize knowledge it will hopefully not give any detail about the point of the entire mechanism,x generator access,1
activating this stud should give you access to the fusion generator used to power this facility,x sequence stud,1
activating this toggle stud will most likely bring up a concise listing of the steps needed to use yilonomordel on the control surface viewscreen it probably has text that cheryl could decipher but hopefully it includes symbolic instructions despite your bravado yilonomordel is on a vastly different scope that any other yi technology you have worked with and youll need help getting it goinghelp you can not rely on cheryl for unfortunately cheryl seems to be able to see the viewscreen pretty clearly,x forcefield stud,1
you are no coward but you know when you can use some help so you always have an eye open for something like this activating this stud probably turns on a forcefield generator around the control slaband yi forcefields are nearly impenetrable by human technology this might come in handy if cheryl was not always so close to the slab,touch information,1
this is the only stud you were able to activate when you were here before and you are positive that it will produce the information cheryls looking forwhich would make her bring todays session to a halt it might be enough information for her to figure out what this place is if so youd never get a chance to try again so you better not activate it unless youve got some way to stop her,touch generator,1
you touch your fingertip gently against the generator access stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it a pale green energy appears on the monitor hologram cheryl says whats that dont touch to the right a white pillar with an elliptical crosssection slides up out of the floor cheryl says you better know what youre doing here tolan,reply,1
you say im looking for the manual override,x white pillar,1
this looks to be the fusion generator it is an elliptical white pillar almost two meters tall one meter wide and half a meter deep on the long front side is an access panel which is closed cheryl says well of course id help but im busy watching you,reply,1
you say of course,touch panel,1
you touch your fingers to the access panel and immediately recognize the subtle flow of energy through the surface how much easier this would be if you could see in the electromagnetic spectrum after a moment of concentration you align the energy in your fingertips against the flow the access panel swings open revealing a fusion generator bay cheryl says what exactly is that,reply,1
you say it is a wiring crossover terminal something is not connected correctly,x bay,1
the fusion generator bay is a spherical chamber which houses several yi components you recognize comprise a plasma generatora much bigger generator than you have ever seen in your long lifewhile the one remaining mechanism must be a plasma containment systemsomething you have always suspected the yi were capable of despite it being beyond your species ability to produce closer inspection of the containment system reveals twelve contact points you recall noticing a tool stud which might give you something useful for analyzing the situation cheryl says oh right i should have recognized it,x contact points,1
the twelve contacts are arranged around the edge of the plasma generation zone in perfect symmetry they all look quite identical,touch tool stud,1
you touch your fingertip gently against the tool stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it a slot appears on the top of the slab to the left rising out of the slot is an electropulse probe cheryl says what is that hands off tolan she grabs it as it emerges,wait,1
time passes cheryl says you can have this once im sure its safe tolan she examines the probe carefully then aims it so neither end is pointing at either of you and fiddles with it for a moment although you cannot see anything happening directly cheryls monitor hologram lights up with a multicolored iridescent sphere which slowly fades away cheryl says huh just an electromagnetic toy she sets it down on the slab,take probe,1
taken,x probe,1
a thin cylindrical halfmeterlong rod the electropulse probe is a common yi device for working with certain kinds of yi technology the subtle interplay of electric and magnetic fields found in mechanisms can be stimulated with the probe useful for detection analysis or calibration at one end are two control sensors,ask cheryl for hologram,1
cheryl says this monitor hologram is how im keeping tabs on you if i dont have it youre not going to get to do anything anything at all cheryl thinks for a moment and then speaks again however i recall we confiscated a pair of electromagneticsensitive goggles from you back when we found you here she speaks into her communicator several minutes later one of the guards stands in the doorway and tosses the goggles on the floor next to you then leaves,wear goggles,1
first taking the electromagnetic goggles you clumsily struggle to put on the electromagnetic goggles and the room suddenly bursts to life visually whorls and eddies of energy play over every surface of the room but the window although it is a far cry from being able to directly perceive this much of the electromagnetic spectrum it is far far more than you have been forced to live with for some time the one drawback is that it is difficult to read displays since the display spectrum is compressed to such a narrow band and the display circuitry itself is exposed,x generator,1
the white pillar the fusion generator is an elliptical pillar with small amounts of energy playing over it energy flows in a regulated way across an access panel which is open revealing a fusion generator bay cheryl sighs tolan do you have any idea how important it is we figure this place out once and for all,x bay,1
the fusion generator bay houses several yi components you recognize comprise a plasma generator while the remaining mechanism must be a plasma containment system the containment system has twelve contact points there is little energy flow to be seen since the generator is off cheryl says the problem is with the lono as you might guess,probe contacts,1
you put the electropulse probe into the fusion generator bay you trigger the top sensor a sharp multicolored burst of electromagnetic radiation pulses out of the tip of the probe the contact points in the fusion generator bay resonate in responseall but the ninth one which stays utterly black there is probably a recalibration stud for each of the contacts amongst the giant array of controls on the slab it is a good thing you got the goggles the probe flash tends to overwhelm the details on cheryls hologram anyway cheryl says theyre coming back tolan soon we think so before they show up im going to have found a way to put an end to it with your help,press bottom,1
you trigger the bottom sensor and the ambient electromagnetic activity in the probe increases significantly cheryl says you probably never realized it tolan but the yi had a somewhat high opinion of themselves the word yi isnt just their nameit means the end or the ultimate the yilonomordel isnt the yis lono weapon its the final lono weapon they were planning to win their war with it,wait,1
time passes cheryl says so i guess ill finally make it into the history books by doing it for them,touch calibration,1
timing your action carefully you touch your fingertip gently against the calibration stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it a sharp multicolored burst of electromagnetic radiation pulses out of the tip of the probe the contact points in the fusion generator bay resonate in response you are confident it will power up now,take probe,1
taken,shut panel,1
you close the generator access panel,press powerup,1
you touch your fingertip gently against the powerup stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it the fusion generator pillar radiates a sequence of colors dark red deep purple light blue and then builds and peaks with a very bright yellow cheryls monitor hologram reveals significant electromagnetic activity beginning to occur within the fusion generator it looks like powering up was a good place to start that was fairly obvious but you have no intuition about what to do next with a mechanism on this scale the grid of stud offers thousands of studs any of which could plausibly be involved cheryl says youre making quite a bit of progress tolan,press project status stud,1
you touch your fingertip gently against the project status stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it projected on the left half of the far wall of the room an installation status display showing the current configuration of yilonomordel appears on the installation status display the indicator corresponding to this asteroid changes color cheryl says whats this she takes a step closer to it shoot no text,remove goggles,1

the installation status display uses crisp simple geometric symbols to display a representation of the entire yilonomordel installation the star system you are in now with the twenty asteroids including this one orbiting it and the twenty stars arrayed around it like the vertices of a dodecahedron each with twenty asteroids of their own the indicator corresponding to this asteroid is glowing brighter than those for the other asteroids cheryl says i cant imagine how you can stand wearing those bulky things of course they make a huge difference in what you see,x indicator,1

activating this stud no doubt transmits a signal of some sort presumably to the other asteroids in the yilonomordel installation considering their ability to miniaturize the yi would not need an external transmission source the transmitter is probably right inside the slab however given the location and energy necessary the signal it produces will surely be visible on cheryls monitor hologram or through your electromagnetic goggles,put probe in slab,1

damp passage this is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards you can see a crossroads to the west and two nearly identical passages lead east and northeast a stone channel wide and deep steeply descends into the room from the south it is covered with moss and lichen and is far too slippery to climb the channel crosses the room but the opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble,northeast,0

cultural complex this imposing anteroom the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the gue is adorned in the ghastly style of the gues grotesque period with leering gargoyles cartoonish friezes depicting longforgotten scenes of gue history and primitive statuary of pointyheaded personages unknown perhaps very very distant progenitors of the flatheads the place would have been best left undiscovered north of here a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription convention center to the east under a fiftystory triumphal arch a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the royal theater a relatively small and unobtrusive sign perhaps ten feet high stands nearby south a smaller and more dignified ie postdimwit path leads into what is billed as the hall of science,north,0
convention center lobby you are standing at the entrance of the gue convention center on the floor you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust although the whole cultural center appears to have been longabandoned loud lowpitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north and while these sounds most closely approximate those made by underlubricated granola fabricators they nonetheless fill you with dread next to the door is a sign and to the signs left northwest to you is a souvenir stand the cultural centers lobby lies to the south,northwest,0

theater this cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the gue built to the precise specifications of lord dimwit flathead its excessive structure holds seats not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the th mezzanine the seats themselves are built like thrones with high wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees a long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the cultural center to the west to the oversized stage to the east in all other directions narrow aisles have been arranged in the maze of twisty passages style that was so popular in dimwits day i would strongly recommend avoiding them,east,0

museum of illusion the museum of illusion was dedicated to the memory of the great implementers figures who were believed to have created the gue as an act of pure will before you a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood legend has it that so lifelike were these busts that they would seem to talk among themselves discussing history the arts music and philosophy much as those mythic figures did in the golden age of text adventures but years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finelywrought pedestals now alas the only two that remain are those of marc blank and mike berlyn bloodied but unbent battered but unbroken shaken but not stirred worse than the physical desecration of this shrine it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains for now above the busts is a sign reading consult the oracles zorkmids beneath the sign is a coinsized slot mikes eyes like those on a famous sciencefiction adventure game box seem to follow you as you approach marc wake up we have company,put coin in slot,1
